# Wallet UI redesign and consistency plan

This is the maintained checklist for completing the remaining GenericRequest,
Send, Convert, Receive, and VerusID design work. Use it to resume a scoped task
without repeating the entire investigation.

## Current position

- Created: 2026-09-10.
- Last updated: 2026-10-22.
- Scoped VerusID page: **ID-2** on `claude/verusid-page` from `63a8c0b2`. The
  owner chose "D revised" on 2026-10-22: the light card without a mark,
  Control, Content and Details above Funds, and a fund row that opens its
  asset screen with the VerusID card. The tab icon stays the @ mark. iOS QA on
  the normal and SE simulators passed in light and dark; Android is open.
- Scoped Receive restyle: **RX-2** on `claude/receive-restyle` from `e8992c94`.
  Owner approved Calm address (A) and the payment-request paper slip (C) on
  2026-10-20. Round-2 Android corrections pass on `Pixel_8_API_35`: native
  modal keyboard resizing, long-address truncation, and card type labels.
  Device QA on iOS 17 Pro, iPhone SE, Android Pixel 8 and 360x640 passed after
  fixes (see the RX-2 log rows); RX-2.6 QR decoding stays open.
- Scoped wizard title change: `claude/wizard-header-title` from `78ebe3c7`.
  The owner approved short header titles on 2026-10-17. Send/Convert removes
  large content titles and repeated subtitles, retains Amount context and
  fallback messages, and uses a 24-point top inset on normal/compact devices.
  The orchestrator owns rendered and keyboard-error QA.
- Scoped funding follow-up: A-33 on `claude/fix-pending-token-spends` from
  `70bb06c8`. Funding reads every input of each distinct spending mempool
  transaction with a fresh request. Token-only deltas can omit previous
  outpoints. Source, private Testnet RPC, and Node fixture checks pass.
  Orchestrator device QA stays open; no UI or preflight copy changes.
- Scoped keyboard-error fix: **A-34** on
  `claude/fix-wizard-error-keyboard` from `70bb06c8`. Amount and Recipient
  place the shared error directly after the field. Measured scrolling reveals
  it after error, content, or keyboard/viewport changes. Local checks pass;
  the orchestrator owns new Android/iOS light/dark normal/compact device QA.
- Scoped wizard polish: A-26, I-28, A-31, A-30, I-29, and A-8 on
  `claude/fix-wizard-polish` from `5cbbac30`. Rejection copy, self-send balance,
  review spacing, form error flow, save-chip visibility, and focused-header
  progress have source/fixture checks. Orchestrator device QA stays open.
- Scoped history tap/detail follow-up: I-21, A-29/I-30, and A-28 on
  `claude/fix-history-tap-detail` from `5cbbac30`. The native View around
  `SignedInEdgeFade` blocks SVG hit testing before it can cover the first row.
  Conversion Type case and dark header/action colors are corrected. Source
  checks pass; the orchestrator owns new iOS/Android rendered and touch QA.
- Scoped Confirm/Success follow-up: A-5/A-6/A-7, I-7/I-8/I-12, and
  I-16 rejection copy on `claude/fix-wizard-review-success` from `a1e758fd`.
  Implementation and source fixture checks are complete. The orchestrator owns
  Android/iOS light/dark and normal/compact device QA. TX-1.8/TX-1.9 stay open.
- Scoped Amount/Recipient fixes: A-23/I-9, A-9/I-11, A-10/I-10,
  A-12/I-14, and I-13 on `claude/fix-wizard-amount-recipient` from
  `a1e758fd` are ready for orchestrator device QA. Shared keyboard layout,
  amount precision, Continue-time identity lookup, network subtitle, and saved
  address filtering have source/fixture evidence. No Metro or device work ran.
- Scoped balance follow-up: I-16/A-11 on
  `claude/fix-balance-after-broadcast` from `a1e758fd` is ready for device QA.
  VRPC totals include mempool deltas. Successful sends expire address-response
  caches and refresh the source channel. Open wizards follow the ledger.
  The historical duplicate-input cause remains a node-side inference.
- Scoped history follow-up: A-16/I-20 on `claude/fix-history-conversions`
  from `a1e758fd`. VRPC grouping, pending time, conversion labels, and recipient
  metadata have source/RPC fixture checks. I-21 stays open: the C6 press callback
  and detail data work in the source fixture, but no native touch check ran.
- Scoped correctness follow-up: **I-16** on `claude/fix-mempool-spent-utxos`
  from `a1e758fd`. Funding excludes mempool-spent confirmed UTXOs with a fresh
  request and stops when the pending check fails. Local checks pass; the
  orchestrator owns consecutive-send device QA. TX-1 runtime boxes stay open.
- Scoped correctness follow-up: A-15/A-20 conversion estimates on
  `claude/fix-conversion-estimates` from `f22b7ab9` are ready for device QA.
  Numeric RPC serialization and daemon-only Amount estimates have local fixture
  and read-only private Testnet RPC evidence. TX-1 runtime boxes stay open.
- Scoped TX-1 follow-up: A-21/A-22 on `claude/fix-eth-export-recipient`.
  Ethereum export detection and the received-asset label are fixed. Source,
  option-matrix, and private-chain unsigned-build checks pass. Native QA stays
  with the parent task; this work does not close TX-1.8 or TX-1.9.
- Status: SH-1, RX-1, and ID-1 complete for their scoped local deliveries. The
  scoped ID-1 delivery is committed as `33865cab` and locally integrated into
  `codex/integrate-generic-request-upstream`; its rendered/native QA and the
  single independent high-risk review are done. GR-1 and GR-2 are complete:
  the GR-3 runtime matrix closed GR-1.9, GR-1.10, and GR-2.6 on 2026-10-10.
  Global QA-1 stays open across workstreams.
- Source-analysis baseline: `fecfbce4e5eba42e238a9960f30e7cd049ed08ba` on
  `codex/integrate-generic-request-upstream`.
- Evidence: source and fixture behavior checks, the data-lab Mobile contract suite,
  isolated iOS/Android native previews, and Android build/entry checks.
  Authenticated wallet delivery is now verified on iOS and in an Android smoke
  pass; see the GR-3 log entries.
- Current scoped fix (user, 2026-10-17): **A-19**, prevent Back from a successful
  Send/Convert from exposing a live submit action. Implementation and source
  checks are complete on `claude/fix-send-success-back`; orchestrator device QA
  is next. The remaining TX-1 redesign work stays open.
- Earlier focus (user, 2026-10-15): **SV-1**, the Services tiles and the
  fixed gift card screen. `claude/sv1-prep` added the DESIGN.md patterns, the
  `AcknowledgeSheet` `dismissLabel`, and the SV-1 brief. Track A (Services) and
  Track B (gift card) ran in two parallel sessions and are both merged into
  `redesign`. The Android run and a daemon claim followed. SV-1.15 and
  SV-1.16 are fixed; SV-1.17 is decided (no code change). See the SV-1 log
  rows.
- Earlier focus: **GR-3** on `codex/gr3-request-matrix`. Phase 2 is done: the
  user agreed the bug list and Phase 3 scope, and the agreed functional fixes
  (GR3-B6, B3, B2, R1) are verified on the iOS simulator. GR3-B4
  waits by user choice. Compact screenshots are deferred, and the
  physical-iPhone run remains. Phase 3 is implemented (GR-3.12 to GR-3.15,
  GR-3.18, GR-3.19). Phase 4: GR-3.16 ran (iOS rerun and Android smoke) and
  waits only on wallet backup (GR-3.9); GR-3.17 closed the GR-1/GR-2 runtime
  follow-up. GR3-B8 is recorded for later.
- Next focus (user, 2026-10-11): **NFC-1** on `codex/nfc-1-claim-from-card`.
  NFC-1.1–1.7 and the NFC tap screen (NFC-1.9–1.11) are done on the simulator,
  in one commit with NFC-1 (user). Next, one physical-iPhone session runs
  GR-3.9 and NFC-1.8 together.
- Previous focus: **ID-1 complete and locally integrated**, committed as
  `33865cab` on `codex/id1-redesign` and integrated into
  `codex/integrate-generic-request-upstream`. RX-1 remains complete with the
  user-requested system amount keypad, 196 native gallery captures, 32 passing
  focused behavior checks, and ready high-risk and design reviews. The next
  scoped implementation is the remaining TX-1 work when authorized. Broader
  authenticated/runtime and accessibility follow-up remains explicitly tracked
  under QA-1.
- Authority: creating this plan authorized documentation only. Later user
  instructions determine which work to execute. Unchecked boxes do not authorize
  starting the entire backlog. Existing authorization carries across sessions.

## Overview

| Workstream | Outcome | Status | Dependency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GR-1 | Credential and data-signing reviews use current request patterns | Ready for verification | Existing request-review primitives |
| GR-2 | Remaining request flows report delivery status accurately | Ready for verification | Coordinate with GR-1; can be implemented separately |
| GR-3 | Every GenericRequest type has runtime evidence; remaining request surfaces use the current design | In progress | GR-1, GR-2; deeplink-sim and provisioning webhook |
| NFC-1 | A gift card on an NFC card can be claimed signed in and signed out | In progress | GR-3.13 claim flow; physical iPhone (with GR-3.9) |
| SH-1 | Selection and information sheets share the approved presentation | Done | Existing canonical sheets; supports TX-1, RX-1, ID-1 |
| TX-1 | Current Send/Convert wizard uses shared layout and sheets | Sheet tasks delivered through SH-1; remaining work not started | SH-1 for sheet migration |
| RX-1 | Receive choices are clear and payment requests have proper steps | Done | SH-1 for sheet migration |
| ID-1 | VerusID linking, details, and status surfaces are consistent | Done | SH-1 where a shared sheet is needed |
| ID-2 | The VerusID list and page use the approved light card, content v1, and funds | Built and iOS-tested; Android open | DESIGN.md "VerusID page"; owner chose "D revised" on 2026-10-22 |
| AL-1 | App alerts use the acknowledgement sheet; most old alerts move onto their screens; old Settings pickers become sheets | Built and iOS-tested; Android open | DESIGN.md "App alerts"; owner chose the sheet (option A) on 2026-10-22 |
| SV-1 | The Services root uses tiles; the gift card screen uses the fixed card | Done on iOS; Android tested, SV-1.15–1.17 closed; NFC write open | DESIGN.md "Services home" and "Gift card detail"; `AcknowledgeSheet` `dismissLabel` |
| QA-1 | Completed scope has recorded visual, behavioral, and review evidence | Relevant SH-1 checks complete; GR-1/GR-2 runtime evidence remains open | Applies to each delivered workstream |

Recommended sequence: GR-1 and GR-2 together, SH-1 with its first real consumer,
TX-1, RX-1, then ID-1. Apply QA-1 to every delivery rather than saving all QA for
the end. Small correctness fixes, such as misleading status text, may be pulled
forward with their own relevant checks.

## How an AI should maintain this file

1. Read this file, [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md),
   [TYPOGRAPHY.md](TYPOGRAPHY.md), and the relevant terms in
   [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md). Current user instructions and the design contract
   remain authoritative; this plan is a backlog, not a replacement design system.
2. Select the authorized workstream. Record its status and current focus above.
   Recheck its current routes, source, Git state, active writers, and applicable
   workspace guidance. Treat baseline paths as starting points, not frozen code.
3. Use `- [ ]` for unfinished tasks and `- [x]` for completed tasks. Retain the
   text and task IDs. Do not delete completed work or rely on strikethrough alone.
4. Check an implementation task when that specific change is implemented and
   inspected. Keep verification boxes open until their evidence exists. Mark the
   workstream **Done** only when its acceptance criteria and relevant QA pass.
5. Use status **In progress**, **Blocked**, **Ready for verification**, or **Done**
   as appropriate. Blocked items remain unchecked. Record the specific blocker
   and next action; elapsed time is not approval or completion.
6. If a task is already solved elsewhere, verify the current implementation and
   record the supporting commit/evidence before checking it. If superseded,
   annotate it and link its replacement; do not mark it implemented.
7. Update the evidence log, current focus, and last-updated date after each
   coherent delivery or handoff. Record one concrete next action. This file
   should remain useful without access to the original chat.
8. Follow current repository rules for checks, reviews, scoped commits, and
   external actions. Keep incidental QA notes in `*.local.md` files. Never place
   credentials, wallet payloads, personal addresses/balances, or sensitive
   screenshots in this tracked plan.

Example resume request: “Work on TX-1 in UI_REDESIGN_PLAN.md. Complete the
authorized local implementation, relevant verification, and checklist update.”

## Preserve these boundaries

- The baseline enables `ENABLE_SIGNED_IN_REDESIGN` on both platforms. Wallet and
  coin-detail Send/Convert actions use `SendWizard`; Receive uses the Transfer
  screens. Recheck before editing. Do not blanket-redesign legacy
  `Coin/SendCoin`, `Coin/ConvertCoin`, or `Coin/ReceiveCoin` just because they exist.
- Authentication and app-encryption reviews, the dedicated Identity Update
  sequence, and the current invoice/revoke/recover work are references or nearby
  consumers. Regressions caused by shared changes are in scope; broad redesigns
  of those flows are not automatically included.
- Preserve source Asset, Card/subwallet, API channel, destination network,
  conversion route, recipient, fees, validation, signing, and transaction state.
- Preserve experimental request gating, credential scope filtering, required
  response signer restrictions, encryption requirements, and per-item consent.
- A signature, response delivery, transaction submission, and transaction
  confirmation are different events. Visible status must identify the event
  that actually occurred. Callback success does not prove payment settlement.
- Invoice-constrained amount, destination, network, route eligibility, and
  completion behavior must survive shared transfer changes. Do not substitute
  an unconstrained generic Send flow for invoice payment.
- Confirm a disposable Testnet wallet and VRSCTEST before authenticated wallet
  QA. Follow the current repository credential rules. Do not use mainnet wallets.
- These tasks do not authorize dependency churn, a package-manager migration,
  broad state-management refactors, backend capability expansion, or publication.

## Shared design starting points

| Need | Reuse or inspect |
| --- | --- |
| Theme and typography | [tokens.js](src/theme/onboarding/tokens.js), [TYPOGRAPHY.md](TYPOGRAPHY.md) |
| Floating sheet shell and dismissal lifecycle | [BottomSheetModal](src/components/BottomSheetModal.js) |
| Selection sheet | [IdentityPickerSheet](src/containers/DeepLink/components/VerusIdIdentityPickerSheet/IdentityPickerSheet.js) |
| Transfer-specific card selection reference | [CoinCardPickerSheet](src/containers/Coin/CoinCardPickerSheet.js) |
| Information sheet | [DeepLinkRequestSheetScaffold](src/containers/DeepLink/components/RequestReview/DeepLinkRequestSheetScaffold.js), [DeepLinkRequestDetailsSheet](src/containers/DeepLink/components/RequestReview/DeepLinkRequestDetailsSheet.js) |
| Request review | [AuthenticationRequestInfo](src/containers/DeepLink/AuthenticationRequestInfo/AuthenticationRequestInfo.js), [AppEncryptionRequestInfo](src/containers/DeepLink/AppEncryptionRequestInfo/AppEncryptionRequestInfo.js) |
| Full-screen stepped task | [ProgressHeader](src/components/ProgressHeader.js), [GiftCardFund](src/containers/Services/ServiceComponents/GiftCardService/GiftCardFund/GiftCardFund.js) |
| Bottom actions and compact forms | [SafeBottomActionStack](src/components/SafeBottomActionStack.js), [AddressBookEditSheet](src/containers/Services/AddressBook/AddressBookEditSheet.js) |
| Search, copy, loading | [AppSearchField](src/components/AppSearchField.js), [AppSearchLauncher](src/components/AppSearchLauncher.js), [CopyAction](src/components/CopyAction.js), [SkeletonLoader](src/components/SkeletonLoader.js) |

Use the approved floating geometry, title/row/action spacing, and semantic states
from these components and DESIGN.md. A `BottomSheetModal` import alone does not
establish consistency. Keep long tasks full-screen and short choices/details in
sheets. Avoid new generic cards, decorative icons, repeated headings, and local
near-copies of existing controls.

## GR-1 — Credential and data-signing review

**Finding:** `UserDataRequestInfo` displays “Credential Request”. It and
`DataPacketRequestInfo` share hard-coded light styles, card-heavy layouts, older
buttons, and dense technical payload displays. Their identity chooser already
uses the canonical sheet. Both request types are experimentally gated.

**Sources:**
[UserDataRequestInfo](src/containers/DeepLink/UserDataRequestInfo/UserDataRequestInfo.js),
[DataPacketRequestInfo](src/containers/DeepLink/DataPacketRequestInfo/DataPacketRequestInfo.js),
[dataRequestInfo.styles](src/styles/deeplink/dataRequestInfo.styles.js),
[experimentalDeeplinks](src/utils/deeplink/experimentalDeeplinks.js),
[userDataRequestValidator](src/utils/deeplink/validator/userDataRequestValidator.js),
[scopedCredentials](src/utils/deeplink/credentials/scopedCredentials.js).

- [x] **GR-1.1** Trace the current handler, validator, credential lookup, response
  builder, and screen props. Record supported data types and restrictions before
  changing presentation. Do not infer a general credential manager from this UI.
- [x] **GR-1.2** State the small design contract using authentication/app-encryption
  review as the exemplar: requester, requested action, responding VerusID,
  inspectable details, and the next required action.
- [x] **GR-1.3** Migrate both screens to semantic colors, shared typography,
  request-review composition, `AppButton`, and `SafeBottomActionStack`.
- [x] **GR-1.4** Show understandable credential names and the data being shared.
  Put secondary scope/encoding metadata behind a details affordance; keep exact
  values inspectable without turning the main page into a JSON dump.
- [x] **GR-1.5** Separate readable statements/data from hashes, bytes, and descriptor
  metadata in Data Packet review. Represent unknown or uninterpretable content
  honestly; never summarize arbitrary signatures as harmless authentication.
- [x] **GR-1.6** Preserve per-credential and per-statement/data-item consent. Reset
  consent when the reviewed payload or responding identity changes. Do not
  remove required acknowledgements merely to reduce copy.
- [x] **GR-1.7** Distinguish locked, loading, no matching credentials, partially
  available credentials, lookup failure, and required-signer-unavailable states.
  Do not report “no credentials” before a lookup has completed successfully.
- [x] **GR-1.8** Give each state an accurate action label and recovery path. Make
  clear when continuing returns only some requested credentials or none.
- [x] **GR-1.9** Verify consent gates, scope/signer/network restrictions, encrypted
  responses, signed-out entry, and mixed-detail requests using disposable data.
  Done 2026-10-10 in GR-3 on VRSCTEST with real taps (GR-3.7, GR-3.16,
  GR-3.17): “Sign data” stays disabled until every item is checked (iOS and
  Android); matching, partial, and missing credential scopes; a required
  signer the wallet does not control shows “Required VerusID unavailable”
  with Switch wallet and sends nothing, and its own ID proceeds; wrong-network
  requests are rejected; credential responses arrive encrypted (harness);
  signed-out entry opens “Unlock wallet to review”, then the review after
  Face ID, and the signed response is verified; credential/data-packet in
  both orders and sign-in + credentials or data packet are verified. Consent
  reset on an identity change is covered by the GR-1 state checks only (the
  test wallet has one eligible VerusID).
- [x] **GR-1.10** Complete relevant QA-1 checks and record delivery evidence.
  Done 2026-10-10 with the GR-3.17 QA-1 record in the evidence log. Recorded
  follow-ups: full VoiceOver/TalkBack walkthrough, reduced motion, and the
  app-wide text-scaling decision.

**Implemented design contract (2026-09-10):** Authentication and app-encryption
review are the exemplars. Both screens reuse semantic theme/typography,
`DeepLinkRequestSourceCard`, request details and identity picker sheets,
`AppButton`, `SafeBottomActionStack`, `CopyAction`, and `SkeletonLoader`.
Credential values and readable signed data stay on the main review; exact
keys, hashes, bytes, scope, and descriptor data are inspectable in sheets.
Per-item checkboxes deliberately remain. Compact pages opt into the existing
sheet scroll cue so content below the requester remains discoverable.
The shared details-sheet body shrinks within the modal's height constraint so
Done remains inside its rounded boundary. Signing errors remain visible above
the primary action in the normal-flow footer, outside the scrolling review.

**Protocol coverage:** User Data supports scoped, encrypted full-credential
responses only; missing keys produce partial or empty contributions. A lookup
or decryption error is a retryable error, never an empty result. Data Packet
supports the handler's messages, descriptors, and statements; opaque bytes
remain explicitly unreadable. Validator, experimental gate, network, required
signer, and encryption restrictions remain authoritative. Native fixture
rendering substitutes wallet storage and signing; GR-1.9 remains open for an
authenticated disposable-wallet mixed request and callback walkthrough.

**Acceptance:** Both request types belong to the current review family in light
and dark mode. Users can understand and inspect what will be sent/signed, which
identity responds, and what is missing. Existing protocol restrictions and
informed consent remain intact. Delivery completion is tracked under GR-2.

## GR-2 — Accurate request completion and response delivery

**Finding:** User Data and Data Packet currently call the default `next` path.
Without another detail opting into automatic delivery, they reach the legacy
`GenericRequestComplete` screen, which displays “Success” before pressing
“Complete” attempts delivery. Newer flows already have a delivery sheet.

**Sources:**
[GenericRequestHome](src/containers/DeepLink/GenericRequestHome/GenericRequestHome.js),
[genericRequestCompletionFlow](src/containers/DeepLink/GenericRequestHome/genericRequestCompletionFlow.js),
[GenericRequestComplete](src/containers/DeepLink/GenericRequestComplete/GenericRequestComplete.js),
[genericRequestDelivery](src/utils/deeplink/genericRequestDelivery.js).

- [x] **GR-2.1** Inventory remaining callers of legacy completion and determine
  which can use existing centralized delivery. Include mixed-detail ordering and
  requests with no response content or no callback destination.
- [x] **GR-2.2** Route applicable credential/data-signing completion through the
  existing delivery mechanism. Avoid adding a second delivery implementation or
  changing the timing of user consent implicitly.
- [x] **GR-2.3** Make visible states accurately describe response preparation,
  sending, sent, redirect handoff, and failed delivery. Preserve any separate
  transaction-result facts; do not imply final settlement from a sent response.
- [x] **GR-2.4** Preserve duplicate-submission protection, retry behavior, the
  guarded exit after failure, and saved-request completion timing. Translate
  technical failures into clear guidance without claiming delivery succeeded.
- [x] **GR-2.5** Verify POST success/failure/retry, redirect handoff, no-callback,
  mixed-detail requests, and repeated button taps using controlled fixtures.
  Record which result was observed and which remains unverified.
- [x] **GR-2.6** Complete relevant QA-1 checks and record delivery evidence.
  Done 2026-10-10: real delivery on iOS for POST, fail once, fail always,
  redirect, and no callback (sign-in + app encryption), data packet fail
  always with Leave without sending, credentials with no response, and an
  identity update retry that redelivered the same txid; Android POST. QA-1
  record in the GR-3.17 evidence row.

**Completion inventory (2026-09-10):** Credential and Data Packet now opt into
centralized delivery. Authentication, app-encryption, and spendable-key flows
already do so. Mixed requests retain the existing accumulated completion policy.
`WalletBackupRequestInfo` and the older `InvoicePaymentConfiguration` retain
legacy completion; its pre-delivery copy now says “Ready to finish” and
“Response not sent”. (GR-3.12 removed this exception and the legacy screen on
2026-10-10.) Dedicated invoice results and inline Identity Update retain
their distinct transaction/update facts. The shared delivery path caches a
prepared signed/encrypted response per request/response pair for retry, rechecks
authentication expiry, and reports POST, redirect, and no-response outcomes
separately. Failure exit does not mark the saved request complete.

**Acceptance:** No broad “Success” state implies a response was delivered before
delivery occurs. Retry does not repeat already completed signing/payment work.
Remaining legacy completion callers are documented, with deliberate exceptions.

## GR-3 — GenericRequest runtime matrix and remaining request redesign

**Finding (2026-10-09, source only):** Mobile accepts nine GenericRequest
detail types. Most review screens use the current design. No authenticated
end-to-end run covers all types. The legacy `GenericRequestComplete` screen still
ends invoice and wallet-backup flows. `WalletBackupRequestInfo` still uses legacy
colors and Paper controls. The “Open in another app” pill in
`GenericRequestHome` uses legacy colors and absolute positioning. Rejected
requests show only an alert.

**Scope decisions (user, 2026-10-09):**

- Exclude DeFi. That is conversion and cross-chain invoice payment. Test invoices
  with native VRSCTEST only. The protocol has no separate DeFi detail type.
- Do not redesign, generate, or test the deprecated LoginConsent v1 and VerusPay
  invoice v1 links. Leave them as they are.
- Test wallet backup and the QR scan path on a physical iPhone with an NFC tag.
- Android gets one smoke pass per type in Phase 4, not the full matrix.
- Add new request generators to deeplink-sim on a separate branch.

**Request inventory (source verdict, 2026-10-09):**

| Detail type | Screen | Design state | Test request source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Authentication | `AuthenticationRequestInfo` | Current (exemplar) | deeplink-sim |
| Authentication + provision identity | `ProvisionIdentityBottomSheet` | Current | `verus-fake-provisioning-webhook` |
| App encryption | `AppEncryptionRequestInfo` | Current (exemplar) | New deeplink-sim generator |
| Identity update | `IdentityUpdateRequestInfo` and its steps | Current (exemplar); content step keeps Paper rows | deeplink-sim fixture setup; new variants |
| User data (credential) | `UserDataRequestInfo` | Current (GR-1) | deeplink-sim data lab |
| Data packet | `DataPacketRequestInfo` | Current (GR-1) | deeplink-sim data lab |
| VerusPay invoice | `InvoiceInfo`, invoice form/review/result | Current; ends on legacy completion | deeplink-sim invoice lab |
| Spendable key (gift card claim) | `SpendableKeyRequestInfo` | Current | Mobile Gift Card service |
| Create wallet backup (NFC only) | `WalletBackupRequestInfo` | Partial; ends on legacy completion | Physical iPhone and NFC tag |

Mixed requests are in scope: authentication with credential, data packet,
invoice, app encryption, or provisioning; credential and data packet in both
orders.

**Test bench:** The local VRSCTEST `verusd` (RPC port 18843) signs requests as
`TestBob.antafri@`. deeplink-sim runs from the `deeplink-sim-deps-update`
worktree. The provisioning webhook runs from `verus-fake-provisioning-webhook`.
Links open with `xcrun simctl openurl` on simulators that hold only the Verus
Mobile debug build. Use only disposable VRSCTEST profiles and identities.

Phase 0 — test bench:

- [x] **GR-3.1** Create the task branch `codex/gr3-request-matrix` from
  `codex/sync` and record this workstream.
- [x] **GR-3.2** Prepare clean normal and compact iOS simulators that hold only
  the Verus Mobile debug build, so no other app claims `verus://` links.
- [x] **GR-3.3** Create a fresh disposable VRSCTEST profile. Enable experimental
  GenericRequests and development HTTP callbacks.
- [x] **GR-3.4** Give the profile a VerusID through the provisioning webhook and
  fund it with a small VRSCTEST amount. Record this as the provisioning run.
  Deviation: Testnet rejects every sub-ID registration ("DeFi functions
  temporarily disabled"), and the app fails after the provisioning POST (bug
  GR3-B1). By user choice, the daemon test ID `liveqa09482856.antafri@` got the
  test wallet's R-address as a second primary address and its shielded address
  as private address. The app linked it through automatic discovery in a
  sign-in request. The provisioning row stays Blocked in the matrix.
- [x] **GR-3.5** Add the missing deeplink-sim generators: app encryption,
  authentication with app encryption, identity-update variants, and negative
  cases (wrong network, expired, bad signature, unknown detail, experimental
  setting off, over-length link).
- [x] **GR-3.6** Confirm that `xcrun simctl openurl` delivers a harness link to
  the debug build and reaches the review screen.

Phase 1 — test run (report only; fix only bugs that block the matrix):

- [x] **GR-3.7** Run each type and mixed request: approve, decline, and Back.
  Run each delivery mode: POST, fail once, fail always, redirect, and no callback.
  Record the observed screen, verified callback, and confirmed transaction as
  separate facts.
  Done on the iPhone 17 Pro simulator, except wallet backup (GR-3.9). All five
  delivery modes ran on authentication + app encryption; identity update ran
  POST and fail once; the other types ran POST. Two matrix-blocking bugs were
  fixed (GR3-B1 provisioning session, GR3-B5 identity content lookup). Four
  bugs stay open for triage (GR3-B2, B3, B4, B6).
- [ ] **GR-3.8** Capture light/dark and normal/compact screenshots of every
  review, processing, result, and error state.
  Light and dark at normal size are captured. Compact is deferred (user,
  2026-10-10): the compact simulator has no profile yet.
- [ ] **GR-3.9** Run wallet backup and the QR scan path on the physical iPhone.
- [ ] **GR-3.10** Write the local report and gallery. Give each row Works,
  Broken, or Blocked with the reason.
  Draft: local `gr3-matrix.local.md` and `docs/qa/gr3/gallery.html`. It becomes
  final after GR-3.8 and GR-3.9.

Phase 2 — triage:

- [x] **GR-3.11** Agree the bug list and redesign scope with the user. Fix
  functional bugs first. Reproduce each bug before its fix.
  Root causes (2026-10-10, local `gr3-matrix.local.md`): B6 is a missing
  `detachInactiveScreens={false}` on the invoice and identity-safety modal
  navigator, so every touch reaches JS twice. B3 is the app-encryption screen's
  own loading sheet colliding with the delivery sheet. B2 is a missing
  `resetDeeplinkData()` after provisioning. B4 is a primitives library Buffer
  defect under Hermes. P1 follows upstream behavior.
  Agreed (user, 2026-10-10): fix B6, B3, B2 and R1 now; leave B4 for later
  (harness workaround stays); all four Phase 3 groups are in scope. Done: each
  bug was reproduced, fixed, and rerun with real taps (see the evidence log).
  P1 stays an upstream question.

Phase 3 — remaining redesign (one scoped delivery each):

- [ ] **GR-3.12** Move invoice and wallet backup from `GenericRequestComplete` to
  the centralized delivery path. Keep the payment result separate from response
  delivery. This replaces the GR-2 exception for these two callers.
  Implemented 2026-10-10: after the last detail, a response with
  details always goes through the delivery sheet; an empty response with no
  detail asking for the sheet finishes without one, because invoices and wallet
  backups add nothing to send and their own screens show the outcome. A detail
  that asks for delivery (for example missing credentials) keeps the “Request
  complete” notice. The legacy screen, its route, and its styles are removed.
  Invoice-only verified on the simulator; wallet backup (no NFC on the
  simulator) and the skipped-backup passthrough are verified by source only and
  wait for the physical iPhone (GR-3.9). The wallet-backup screen still shows
  no “backup written” result; add it in GR-3.13.
- [ ] **GR-3.13** Migrate `WalletBackupRequestInfo` to the semantic theme and
  shared controls. Verify it on the physical iPhone with NFC.
  Implemented 2026-10-10. Request-review composition from
  `AppEncryptionRequestInfo` (title, subtitle, 56-point primary and Cancel);
  options use `SettingsProfileSummary`, `SettingsSwitchRow`, and a
  `SettingsRow` that opens a `SelectionSheet` for brute-force resistance;
  semantic strength colors; the shared `requestWalletUnlock`; no hero icons,
  Paper checkboxes, Paper menu, or filled wallet card. New “Backup written”
  result before the request continues (Done, or Continue when a claim
  follows); Settings no longer adds its own alert. Settings mode no longer
  adds the status-bar inset under its header, the keyboard offset includes the
  header, and the password fields use the onboarding autofill settings. NFC
  write logic, session guards, and completion markers are unchanged. Simulator
  evidence covers every state except a real NFC write (stubbed); the physical
  iPhone run (GR-3.9) is still required.
- [x] **GR-3.14** Fix the small leftovers: the “Open in another app” pill, the
  `InvoicePaymentConfiguration` fallback root, and the Identity Update content
  step Paper rows. Added (user, 2026-10-10): the empty band under “View request
  details” on every review (GR3-D8), the “1 hours” expiry copy (GR3-D9), and the
  “Secure POST” label on plain HTTP destinations (GR3-D6).
  Implemented 2026-10-10, commit `0c75f191`. “Open in another app” is a quiet text
  action in normal flow above the review (no absolute pill, no fixed 100-point
  offset, semantic colors); a nested safe-area provider stops the review from
  adding the status-bar inset again; the chooser is the shared
  `SelectionSheet`, and a failed handoff shows recovery guidance instead of
  the raw link. The unreachable `InvoicePaymentConfiguration` route and its
  legacy fallback root are removed (the invoice review renders it inline).
  The Identity Update private-information rows no longer use Paper `List` and
  `Divider`; one item no longer repeats the group title, and the private
  address uses monospace. D8: the data reviews no longer stack the source-card
  margin, a section margin, and item padding (about 110 to about 42 points);
  on short reviews the remaining space is free space above the footer. D9:
  `blocksToTime` uses whole seconds, correct singular units, and leaves out
  zero units (“1 hour”, “1 hour 1 minute”). D6: one shared delivery label —
  “Secure POST” only for HTTPS, “POST over HTTP” otherwise — in sign-in, app
  encryption, and the data-review details.
- [x] **GR-3.15** Replace rejection alerts with a request error state that gives
  recovery guidance (GR3-D1). In scope by user choice, 2026-10-10.
  Implemented 2026-10-10, commit `39dabf36`. A rejected GenericRequest stays on the
  opening screen, which turns into an error state: one title, one recovery
  sentence, and Close; Try again only when a retry can help (network failure
  or an unknown error). No icon, no step list, no raw error text. The same
  state covers detail-handler failures in `GenericRequestHome`, and a failed
  detail now stops the loop instead of running on to the next detail.
  `genericRequestRejection.js` maps coded errors (wrong network, request not
  valid, signer not verified, expired, unsupported detail, experimental off,
  delegated-signer wallet) and axios transport texts to the copy. Links that
  fail before a request screen exists (too long, unreadable) keep an alert, but
  with translated copy. The shared Paper alert backdrop was opaque black
  because the theme dropped `scrimOpacity`; it now dims the screen. Deprecated
  LoginConsent v1 and VerusPay invoice v1 keep their alerts.
- [x] **GR-3.18** Identity Update high-risk steps: show the address that gains
  control, the current and new authorities, and full names without mid-token
  breaks (GR3-D10, GR3-D2). Add the destination and fee to the gift-card claim
  review. Added by the user, 2026-10-10.
  Implemented 2026-10-10, commit `50727421`. The high-risk step now shows each
  change in full on the step itself: a primary-address change lists the
  removed and added addresses in monospace, and a recovery or revocation change
  shows the current and the new authority, with the new one emphasized. The
  rows keep View for the technical details; the acknowledgement sheet shows each
  name with its i-address. A content key with no known name reads "Unnamed key"
  with its full i-address instead of a four-and-four abbreviation. Long VerusID
  names wrap after a dot instead of inside a name part (`withNameBreaks`, display
  only) in "Updating identity", the provisioning name preview, and the
  provisioning review. The gift-card claim review shows "To" (wallet name and
  receiving address) and "Network fee"; the claim plan now keeps the fee that
  was already subtracted from the shown balance.
- [x] **GR-3.19** Mixed requests: tell the user when a second step follows the
  sign-in review (GR3-D11). Added by the user, 2026-10-10.
  Implemented 2026-10-10, commit `8270ae32`. When another review follows sign-in,
  the sign-in primary action names it instead of signing in: “Continue to sign
  data”, “Continue to share credentials”, “Continue to pay invoice”, “Continue
  to VerusID changes”, “Continue to wallet backup”, or “Continue to claim
  funds”. Nothing is sent until the last step, so “Sign in with VerusID”
  stays only when sign-in finishes the request (sign-in only, or sign-in with
  provisioning, which the sign-in step handles). `genericRequestNextStep.js`
  finds the next detail that opens its own review, in processing order, and
  skips a wallet backup that the passthrough flag skips. The label appears
  after a VerusID is selected; before that the action stays “Choose VerusID”.
  No step counter or progress bar: DESIGN.md does not allow a “Step 2 of 4”
  eyebrow, and the next screen's title matches the action that opened it.

Phase 4 — regression:

- [ ] **GR-3.16** Rerun the matrix on the final branch. Run one Android smoke
  pass per type.
  Run 2026-10-10 on `8270ae32` plus two fixes (commit `dd3a476f`). iOS: every
  in-scope type and mixed request passed again with real taps, including all
  five delivery modes on sign-in + app encryption, fail-once identity update
  with one transaction, both credential/data-packet orders, sign-in + invoice,
  the six rejected-request cases, and the gift-card claim. Android: one smoke
  pass per type on a new disposable profile (app encryption, sign-in + data
  packet, identity update, credentials, rejected requests, provisioning,
  invoice, gift-card claim). Fixed during the run: the gift-card claiming
  state pushed its text to the screen bottom (same `AnimatedActivityIndicatorBox`
  defect as GR-3.13), and the Android identity picker threw on a null
  `accessibilityState` (GR3-B9). New finding GR3-B8: two equal payments to the
  same address inside one block window reuse the first payment's inputs, so
  the second is a byte-identical rebroadcast that the app reports as
  submitted. Gaps: credential matching and provisioning registration (testnet
  sub-ID registration blocked, GR3-E1); wallet backup (no NFC, GR-3.9);
  compact size (deferred). GR-3.14, GR-3.15, GR-3.18, and GR-3.19 are checked
  on this rerun; GR-3.12, GR-3.13, and this item wait for GR-3.9.
- [x] **GR-3.17** Close GR-1.9, GR-1.10, and GR-2.6 where the evidence supports
  it. Refresh `docs/genericrequest-types-and-chains.html`. Complete the relevant
  QA-1 checks.
  Done 2026-10-10. GR-1.9, GR-1.10, and GR-2.6 are closed (see each item). The
  missing runtime checks ran first: required signer (unavailable and own),
  signed-out data-packet entry, request-details sheet close and reopen, and
  Android hardware Back and accessibility labels. The local protocol map
  (`docs/` is ignored by Git) now shows nine supported details, the unsigned
  order rules, the shared delivery path, the error state, the runtime
  evidence per type, and the open items; it renders at desktop and phone
  width in light and dark. Global QA-1 stays open (TX-1 and other workstreams).
- [x] **GR-3.20** Open VerusPay invoice links, identity update links and v1
  login links on the request loading screen instead of the white page with the
  old spinner. Theme the white page behind every request.
  Done 2026-10-22 on `claude/request-loading`. `GenericRequestLoading` takes a
  title and steps; invoices read "Opening invoice" (no Verify signer step when
  unsigned) and all of them have Cancel. Identity update failures (expired,
  signature, other) end on the request error state instead of a raw alert.
  v1 login keeps its alerts. iOS light and dark checked; iPhone SE and Android
  not run.

Recorded for later (user, 2026-10-10; outside the request redesign):

- **GR3-B8** Two payments with the same amount and destination inside one
  block window do not both happen. The second send selects the inputs that
  the first, still unconfirmed payment already spent, so it signs a
  byte-identical transaction. The server returns the first txid without an
  error, and the app shows “Payment submitted” for the second invoice.
  Reproduced three times on iOS (invoice only, 0.01 VRSCTEST to one address);
  a debugger counter showed an identical signed transaction; the mempool held
  one transaction each time. Source: `getSpendableUtxos`
  (`src/utils/api/channels/vrpc/requests/getAddressUtxos.js`) reads only
  `getaddressutxos`, which does not remove inputs spent in the mempool. Not
  run: two payments with different outputs (expected to conflict and fail
  instead). Needs its own task on send input selection; reproduce in a
  failing test first.
- **GR3-D15** (P3) Android hardware Back on a request review returns to
  Wallet and sends nothing, but skips the screen's Cancel handler, so
  `deeplink.id` stays set (Cancel clears it). Reopening the same link works;
  no visible effect seen.
- **Text scaling** (app-wide, QA-1.3): `src/utils/applyGlobalTypography.js`
  sets `allowFontScaling = false` for every `Text` and `TextInput`, so the
  system text size has no effect (checked at the largest iOS size). This is a
  product decision outside GR, not a GR regression.

**Acceptance:** Every in-scope type and mixed request has a recorded runtime
result with its proof level. No in-scope flow ends on the legacy completion
screen. All in-scope request surfaces belong to the current review family in
light and dark mode. Shared changes leave the excluded and deprecated flow
code untouched.

## NFC-1 — Claim from an NFC card

**Finding (2026-10-11, source; GR3-B10):** The app cannot read a Verus NFC
card. Upstream has two signed-out entries that call `readDeeplinkFromNfc`:
“Initialize from NFC” on the first-run screen and “Read deeplink from NFC” in
the signed-out menu. The signed-out redesign removed both (`62c9b54d`,
`5720414d`, 2026-06-08). No record shows that this was intended. iOS does not
open `verus://` links from tags (background tag reading supports only universal
links and system schemes), so an iPhone has no other path. Effects: a gift card
on an NFC card cannot be claimed with Verus Mobile alone, and the “Claim this
card” choice in `WalletBackupRequestInfo` (it needs `passthrough.fromNfc`) never
appears. Upstream never had a signed-in entry.

Related finding (source): onboarding “Scan QR code” (`CreateProfile`
`handleScan`) uses any scanned text as the imported seed, without a review
step. A gift-card QR scanned there becomes the new wallet's seed.

**Decisions (user, 2026-10-11):**

- Use the label “Claim from NFC card” in all three places.
- Signed out, no wallets: a row in the “Get started” sheet.
- Signed out, with wallets: a row in Login → Other options.
- Signed in: a button on Home → Scan.
- Hide the entries on devices without NFC.
- Include the onboarding QR fix.
- Build NFC-1 first. Then one physical-iPhone session covers GR-3.9 and NFC-1.
- Added (user, 2026-10-11): put the NFC tap screen from the “NFC Tap Moments”
  page (the simple version) into every NFC read and write, in the same commit
  as NFC-1. A card with other content (a wallet backup, no Verus link) shows one
  line and one action in the same screen, not an alert (proposed in the
  integration report; the user continued without a change).

**Design contract:** Scope is the two signed-out sheets, the Scan screen's
bottom button, the shared read action and its messages, the global
`LoadingModal` (the read status surface), and the onboarding QR result.
Exemplars are the existing rows of each sheet (`SignedOutActionRow` in the start
sheet, the Other options rows) and the scanner's safe bottom button slot as
`SendWizardRecipient` uses it. Shared primitives: `BottomSheetModal`,
`createSignedOutSheetStyles`, `AppButton`, `readDeeplinkFromNfc`. States: entry
shown or hidden by NFC support; reading (iOS system sheet, Android status with
Cancel); cancelled; failed; wallet-backup card; card without a Verus link;
success into the request flow. Deviation: `LoadingModal` gets semantic theme
colors so that it follows dark mode. It also serves the onboarding and
wallet-backup wallet setup. The NFC tap screen (NFC-1.9) replaced
`LoadingModal` as the read status surface.

**Tap screen design contract (NFC-1.9–1.11):** Scope is the status screen of
all four NFC operations: claim read (the three entries), wallet backup write
(Settings and request), wallet backup read (restore), and gift card write.
Exemplar: the simple version on the “NFC Tap Moments” page (one contactless
symbol, one line, help only after a failure; symbol at the top on iPhone and
in the middle on Android). Shared primitives: new `NfcTapView` (and
`NfcTapModal` / `NfcTapHost` for full-screen use), `AppButton` at 56 points
with the request-review secondary style, `SafeBottomActionStack`, theme roles
`titleSheet` and `bodySm`, one new token `primaryBackground` (existing values
`#EEF2F8` and `rgba(49, 101, 212, 0.24)`). States: preparing (backup only),
waiting, active, release (Android), done, failed, notice; light and dark;
normal and compact; reduced motion. Deviations: no Cancel while a backup is
prepared, because the encryption blocks the JS thread and a Cancel could not
respond; failures name the cause where the app knows it (“No card found”,
“Card moved too soon”, “NFC is off”), not only “Card moved too soon”.

Tasks:

- [x] **NFC-1.1** Record GR3-B10 and this plan.
- [x] **NFC-1.2** Shared read action: plain prompts and messages; no alert
  after a user cancel; a wallet-backup card leads to “Restore from NFC backup”
  when signed out and gets an explanation when signed in; an NFC support check
  for the entries; theme colors for `LoadingModal`.
  Done 2026-10-11. `readDeeplinkUriFromNfc` uses plain wording and returns
  codes for a user cancel (`NFC_READ_CANCELLED`, no alert) and a card without
  a Verus link (`NFC_NO_VERUS_LINK`, “Nothing to claim”); other failures show
  “Card not read”. `isNfcSupported` plus `useNfcSupported` hide the entries.
  `LoadingModal` uses the sheet color, `titleSheet`, and `AppButton`; it was
  white in dark mode before, also in onboarding wallet setup. Found and fixed
  during QA: a read that ended while the status modal still slid in left the
  native modal on screen above the next alert (Redux said closed). The status
  modal now stays at least 500 ms; this also covers a card already at the phone.
  NFC-1.9 replaced the status modal and the alerts with the tap screen; it keeps
  the 500 ms minimum, and a result no longer closes one modal to open another.
- [x] **NFC-1.3** “Get started” row (signed out, no wallets).
  The row shows only when no claim is in progress (`resumePendingDeeplinkId`).
- [x] **NFC-1.4** Other options row (signed out, with wallets). First row.
- [x] **NFC-1.5** Scan button (signed in). Uses the scanner's bottom button
  slot; the no-camera view shows it too. Address-only scanners and callers
  with their own button are unchanged.
- [x] **NFC-1.6** Onboarding QR: a scanned `verus://` link opens as a request,
  not as a seed. Setup closes first, so Cancel returns to Welcome.
- [x] **NFC-1.7** Simulator evidence: the rows and the button in light and dark,
  normal and compact (NFC support stubbed for capture only); the request flow
  from a simulated read; parser, design, and safe-area checks; the existing NFC
  read tests.
- [ ] **NFC-1.8** Physical iPhone with a card, in the GR-3.9 session: each entry
  reads a funded gift card; signed in, “Claim to existing wallet”; signed out
  with wallets, “Claim this card”; no wallets, create a wallet, back it up to
  the card, then claim; cancel; wrong card. Android: emulator UI only (no NFC
  hardware). Tap screen on the phone: the iOS scan sheet text per step, the
  success and error close of the sheet, the haptics, the timing of the check,
  and that the app's security cover does not hide the tap screen while the
  sheet is open.
- [x] **NFC-1.9** NFC tap screen. `walletBackupNfc.js` runs every card
  operation through one runner that reports a phase (waiting, active, done,
  release) and gives errors codes (cancelled, NFC off, timeout, card moved,
  no Verus link, no wallet backup). It sets the iOS scan sheet text (“Hold
  still.”, “Done.”, “Backup written.”) and closes the sheet with an error text
  on a failure. Card checks, overwrite guards, and the Android release hold are
  unchanged. `NfcTapView` draws the symbol (Animated plus SVG, native driver
  for the loops): waves pulse while waiting, a ring turns while active, a green
  check with one ripple when done, a red mark with a shake on failure, an
  orange mark for a notice. Haptics: light on card found (Android), success,
  error, warning. Reduced motion stops the loops, the shake, and the ripple.
  The security cover is not shown while an NFC session is open (iOS makes the
  app inactive under the scan sheet; to confirm on the phone).
- [x] **NFC-1.10** The tap screen in all four operations. Claim read: an
  app-wide host (`state.nfcTap`) replaces the status modal and the alerts;
  results offer Try again, Restore wallet, or Close in the same screen.
  Wallet backup: preparing, the card steps, and the result with its protection
  text and Done or Continue in one view; a failure offers Try again (keeps the
  confirmed options) and Cancel. Restore: the card steps, then the password
  step or the import. Gift card: the card steps, then “Gift card written” with
  Done instead of the system “Success” alert; Cancel after a failure rolls the
  share back without an alert. A user cancel ends without a message everywhere.
- [x] **NFC-1.11** Simulator evidence with an in-app fake NFC chip (installed
  through the debugger, no app code); see the evidence log.

Recorded for later (found in NFC-1 QA; existing claim-flow behavior):

- **GR3-D16** After “Claim submitted” → Done, the delivery step adds a
  “Request complete / No response was sent to the requester” sheet. A gift
  card has no requester, so the second confirmation is noise. Source: the
  claim's Done calls `completeWithDelivery` / `next(..., {autoDeliverOnComplete:
  true})` (since `33eb5624`).
- **GR3-D17** Reading a card whose claim is still unconfirmed shows “Pending
  claim transaction / Retry when your connection is available”. The broadcast
  worked (the transaction was in the mempool), so the connection hint is wrong.
  Seen again in the tap screen QA after “Backup written” → Continue on the
  same, already claimed test link.

Recorded for later (found in the tap screen QA; existing behavior):

- **NFC-D1** Android keeps the card session open for 5 seconds after a success
  (`NFC_POST_WRITE_ANDROID_HOLD_MS`, so that the phone does not read the card
  again). The check therefore stays 5 seconds before the claim or restore
  screen opens. Option: open the next screen during the hold.
- **NFC-D2** Back from the restore setup step returns to the NFC step, which
  starts a new read by itself (`autoStart` on mount). On iPhone the scan sheet
  opens again.
- **NFC-D3** After the signed-out unlock in a wallet-backup request, the
  request starts again and shows “Claim this card” a second time.
- **NFC-D4** The restore start screen (“Import using NFC”, Paper button) is
  legacy UI; only its scan states use the tap screen.

**Acceptance:** From each of the three entries, a funded gift card on an NFC
card opens the claim flow on a physical iPhone, and the funds arrive. Cancel
and wrong-card cases show no technical text. Devices without NFC show no entry.

## SH-1 — Consistent sheet presentation and dismissal

**Finding:** Many transfer and VerusID sheets use the shared shell but explicitly
set `floating={false}` and duplicate their headers, rows, actions, and overflow
handling. Some clear visible content or navigate before the shell finishes closing.

- [x] **SH-1.1** Inventory active consumers in TX-1, RX-1, and ID-1. Classify each
  as selection, information, compact form, blocking processing, or a full task.
  Record intentional exceptions rather than applying one height to everything.
- [x] **SH-1.2** Compare the running identity selector and transfer card picker
  with proposed consumers at matching size/theme. Use DESIGN.md as authority.
- [x] **SH-1.3** Reuse or minimally extract a shared selection composition from
  the approved pattern. Preserve transfer-specific balance, network, route, and
  address information; do not force it into identity-specific data structures.
- [x] **SH-1.4** Reuse the information scaffold for fee and supported-chain details.
  If its DeepLink location obstructs reuse, extract the smallest shared component
  while preserving existing wrappers and behavior.
- [x] **SH-1.5** Standardize floating geometry, semantic selected states, titles,
  action rows, keyboard handling, measured overflow cues, and quiet Done actions
  where appropriate. Preserve explicit exit controls for blocking/nested tasks.
- [x] **SH-1.6** Separate visibility changes from destructive cleanup. Keep
  selected content mounted through closing; use `onClosed` for cleanup/navigation
  that must wait. Check rapid reopen and reduced-motion behavior.
- [x] **SH-1.7** Migrate with a real consumer and verify existing canonical
  consumers immediately. Do not create a broad unused sheet framework.
- [x] **SH-1.8** Complete relevant QA-1 checks and record migrated consumers and
  deliberate exceptions in the evidence log.

**SH-1 inventory and design contract (2026-09-11):**

| Active surface | Classification | SH-1 disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Send/Convert source Card, destination network, route | Selection | Migrated to `SelectionSheet` and semantic selected rows; existing eligibility, balance and route data preserved |
| Send saved addresses and self addresses | Searchable selection / selection | Migrated; address/network filtering preserved; exact address remains available; Address Book navigation deferred until closed |
| Send confirmation fee breakdown | Information | Migrated to `InfoSheet` with unchanged fee data and preflight explanation |
| Receive Card and address choice | Selection | Migrated; Card and address choices are named separately; selection applied after closing |
| Receive supported chains | Information | Migrated to `InfoSheet`, section rows, measured overflow and quiet Done |
| VerusID chooser and Coin Card picker | Specialized selection exemplars | Retain canonical composition; regression checked alongside migrated sheets |
| Address Book edit and manual identity link | Compact form / nested form | Retain existing dedicated keyboard and save/link handling; broader migration belongs to TX-1 / ID-1 |
| Receive payment-request amount/subject/settings/result | Full task | Migrated by RX-1.5 to a full-screen stepped task (`ReceivePaymentRequestFlow`) with `ProgressHeader`, `FadedScrollView` and `SafeBottomActionStack`; the 90% attached sheet is removed |
| VerusID discovery/linking | Nested searchable task | Retain canonical floating 76% sheet and existing post-close manual-link handoff |
| VerusID explanation FAQ | Information with disclosure | Existing floating sheet retained; FAQ consolidation and copy remain ID-1.9 |
| VerusID pending status and unlink confirmation | Action/status and destructive confirmation | Keep explicit guarded exit and action behavior; lifecycle/presentation migration stays with ID-1.3 |
| GenericRequest delivery and Identity Update processing | Blocking processing / stepped task | Preserve existing completion, consent and transaction semantics |

The shared selection composition follows the running identity selector's floating
shell, 18-point row radius, 16-point row inset, 4-point row spacing and semantic
success selection. `SelectionRow` uses a 56-point minimum and grows for balances,
network/route details, complete addresses, and text scaling. Titles use the shared
20/26 role; task rows use the canonical 62-point minimum. The searchable
saved-address sheet fills the 76% shell to keep loading, empty,
error and loaded states stable. With the Android keyboard open, it uses 90% of
the remaining height and moves the management action into the scroll content so
one complete address remains legible; Android uses native modal resizing. The
fade gives way to the native scroll indicator below a 128-point viewport. Other short
choices retain their intrinsic height. The information scaffold
and rows moved to `InfoSheet` / `InfoSheetSection`, retaining the DeepLink exports
as compatibility wrappers. `SheetScrollView` supplies the existing measured fade
and chevron to both families. Simple sheets dismiss by outside tap/system back;
information sheets also have the quiet 56-point Done action.

Visibility is separate from pending source/target/Card content. `useSheetDismissal`
queues one choice or navigation callback for `onClosed`, cancels it on a rapid
reopen, and dismisses the keyboard. Existing shell animation and reduced-motion
behavior remain authoritative. No signing, preflight, transaction, invoice, or
identity-management capability is changed.

**Acceptance:** Migrated sheets feel like the same component family and preserve
their task-specific information. No blank/reset flash or competing navigation
occurs during dismissal. Canonical consumers retain their existing behavior.

- [ ] **TX-1.2** Adopt `ProgressHeader` and the approved signed-in wizard
  composition. Preserve correct progress when steps are skipped. Expose one
  clear exit on initial/result states; retain necessary back navigation elsewhere.
- [x] **TX-1.HEADER-TITLE** Move Send/Convert step titles into the header,
  centered between back and close in `titleSheet`. Remove large content titles
  and repeated helper copy. Keep Amount context and missing-selection messages.
  Use a 24-point content top inset on normal and compact devices.
- [ ] **TX-1.HEADER-TITLE-QA** Orchestrator: verify all five titles in Android
  and iOS light/dark, including 360dp Android and 375pt iPhone SE. Check title
  fit, Back/close/progress, missing-selection states, and Amount/Recipient
  keyboard errors scrolling into view. TX-1.8/TX-1.9 remain open.
- [x] **TX-1.CONTEXT-BAND** Replace the Amount context line with a context band
  under the Send/Convert header on Amount and Recipient (owner-approved option C,
  2026-10-17). Contract: `DESIGN.md`, Stepped tasks. No band on Confirm/Success.
- [ ] **TX-1.CONTEXT-BAND-QA** Orchestrator: verify the band on Android and iOS in
  light/dark, 360dp Android and 375pt iPhone SE, with long names, Send to another
  chain on Recipient, keyboard open, and large text.
- [x] **TX-1.NETWORK-GROUPS** Group the Send/Convert network sheet into "Same
  network" (always first) and "Other networks". Plain network names, no "· Same
  network" suffix (owner-approved option 1, 2026-10-18). Contract: `DESIGN.md`.
- [x] **TX-1.AMOUNT-IMPACT** Replace the Amount estimate card with a flat estimate:
  price caption, market price row, and price impact in money with a warning or
  danger `StatusBadge` and a verified "Use <N> instead" suggestion (owner-approved
  option C "say it in money", 2026-10-18). Remove "Enter amount to see estimate".
  Wording approved 2026-10-19: no minus signs, "<money> less than the market price",
  badge "x.x% less", money in the display currency when a price exists and
  otherwise in the received asset.
- [x] **TX-1.VIA-ROW** Show a "Via" row on Amount only when the conversion can take
  more than one basket; best price chosen and labelled "Best price"; "Convert via"
  sheet lists baskets best first with "x.xx% less" for the others. No "Same
  network" on Amount (owner-approved 2026-10-19).
- [x] **TX-1.RECIPIENT-ROWS** Turn the Recipient quick cards into flat rows and
  drop the helper line (owner-approved option A, 2026-10-18).
- [x] **TX-1.CONFIRM-SENT-SPINE** Draw Confirm and Sent as a pay and receive
  spine with a flat fact list and a "Transaction details" sheet (owner-approved
  option B, 2026-10-18).
- [x] **TX-1.AMOUNT-PIN** Pin the Amount estimate (receive row, money line, badge,
  suggestion, Via row) above Continue so it is never below the fold with the keypad
  open, with a compact variant on windows of 667 points or less (owner-approved
  "pin it", 2026-10-19).
- [x] **TX-1.POLISH-3** Owner feedback of 2026-10-19: show "Bridge.vETH" in full, no
  progress bar on Sent, drop the fee sheet subtitle, a better loading state between
  Recipient and Confirm (Confirm skeleton that mirrors the review, button "Preparing…"),
  Confirm notices above Hold, Sent compact on short screens, hide the unit chip without a
  fiat price, route on its own line in the Confirm connector.
- [x] **TX-1.DECLUTTER-CONFIRM-SENT** Owner feedback of 2026-10-19 (second pass): show the
  recipient once on Confirm, no "More details" row, no "centrally controlled currency"
  notice, no header on Sent, no "To" or "Arrives" row on Sent.
- [x] **TX-1.AMOUNT-DECLUTTER** Build owner-approved A2: one pinned receive
  line and a percent chip when impact is at least 0.1%, there is more than one
  basket, or an Ethereum fee needs a quote or has a result. "Price and route"
  holds price, basket choices, fee, and suggestion. Its compact layout now
  follows TX-1.PRICE-ROUTE-DENSE below. Owner chose A2 on 2026-10-19;
  orchestrator device QA remains open.
- [x] **TX-1.PRICE-ROUTE-DENSE** Implement owner-approved variation A:
  basket choices first; no explanatory sentence or section titles; 48-point
  basket, 40-point single-line fact, and 52-point suggestion rows. Only the
  basket list scrolls with the shared cue. Facts and Done stay fixed. Done
  follows the shared small-device rule. Suggestions start from 1% impact:
  WARNING aims to halve impact; DANGER keeps the 3% target. Retain debounce,
  real candidate quotes, and measured lower-impact gating. Device QA pending.
- [x] **TX-1.SMALL-BUTTONS-KEYBOARD** Owner request, 2026-10-19: primary and
  secondary actions use 44 points on windows of 667 points or less, with at
  least 48-point touch targets; wizard footer top padding is 8 points. Use
  neutral Price and route copy. Android Amount and Recipient avoid the keyboard
  from a stable outer layout frame; iOS keeps padding avoidance and the header
  offset. Button rules and voice are recorded in `DESIGN.md`.
- [ ] **TX-1.SMALL-BUTTONS-KEYBOARD-QA** Testers: verify Android 360x640,
  iPhone SE 375x667, and a normal phone in both themes. Check primary/secondary,
  text/tonal, sheet Done, Hold, onboarding, Amount/Recipient errors and Back.
  Repeat sheet-close/refocus at least 20 times on Android. Measure remaining
  Available/MAX clipping with the wrapped pinned receive line and keypad open.
- [ ] **TX-1.UX2-QA** Orchestrator: see the 2026-10-18 and 2026-10-19 evidence rows for
  what was rendered (iOS, Android, iPhone SE 375pt and Android 360dp). Still open:
  large text, fiat money text (no VRSCTEST price on the private chain), Send to
  another chain on Confirm when the Ethereum fee is affordable, long recipient
  names, and the small-device defects listed in the 2026-10-19 pin row.
- [ ] **TX-1.FEE-CHOICE** Owner-approved variation A, 2026-10-20: plain
  ETH/ERC-20 and BTC Network fee choice on Confirm, Slow/Normal/Fast and a
  nested Custom fee form. Use likely Ethereum fees for display and the confirmed
  maximum for safety; BTC uses validated per-byte rates. Bridge/conversion,
  Verus, fixed-fee coins, legacy sends and Sent keep their existing behavior.
  Implementation on `claude/fee-choice`; keep open until orchestrator device QA
  on Sepolia ETH/ERC-20, BTC, iPhone SE, Android 360dp, both themes and keyboard.
  F7/F8 follow-up: computed fee fallback and field-specific Custom errors are
  implemented. Local checks pass; the new device checks remain open.
  D1/D2 follow-up: Custom pins its warning and summary above the action, reveals
  the focused field, and protects tier subtitle width. SE device QA stays open.
  High-fee follow-up: Custom warns above twice Fast's effective gas price or
  sat/vB rate. Local checks pass; orchestrator device QA stays open.
  D3 follow-up replaces the pinned warning and summary with scroll content;
  only Use this fee stays fixed. Focus and content changes reveal Priority.
  Source layout and required checks pass; new device QA stays open.
  Device QA 2026-10-21 (iOS 402pt and iPhone SE, Sepolia ETH, both themes,
  keyboard) passes, including 4 real sends. Still open: ERC-20 (no Sepolia
  token), BTC (no testnet coin; owner deferred) and Android 360dp.
- [x] **TX-1.HISTORY-PROCEEDS** (withdrawn by the owner, 2026-10-19) Label
  conversion proceeds in the Verus history list and the transaction sheet. It read
  "Converted from X" for a received import from the wallet's own system. The
  "Convert to X" label on the sending row (2026-10-17) went in the same decision.
  History rows no longer recognise conversions; see TX-1.HISTORY-NEUTRAL.
- [x] **TX-1.HISTORY-NEUTRAL** Use a neutral history row on the Coin Overview
  (owner-approved option A, 2026-10-19): one gray direction mark, green only on an
  incoming amount, Pending as the status badge in place of the date. Contract:
  `DESIGN.md`, Transaction history row.
- [x] **TX-1.TX-DETAIL-SHEET** Replace the legacy `TxDetailsModal` with
  `TransactionDetailsSheet` (gap 1 of the 2026-10-20 audit; owner asked to build it
  on 2026-10-21). Contract: `DESIGN.md`, Transaction details. Android QA stays open.
- [x] **TX-1.SCAN-SEND** Open Send from scanned payment QR codes (gap 2 of the
  2026-10-20 audit; owner chose option A and the shared Confirm on 2026-10-21).
  Contract: `DESIGN.md`, Scanned payments and VerusPay invoices. Android QA open.
- [x] **TX-1.INVOICE-PAY** Pay VerusPay invoices through Pay with, Confirm and
  Sent, with the payer's payment slip (owner chose slip variation 2 on
  2026-10-21). Signed, two-card, any-amount and Android checks stay open.
- [x] **TX-1.INVOICE-PRICE** Signed slip names the VerusID larger with no badge;
  Pay with shows one row per currency with Send's price impact chip ("x% more")
  and "Price and route"; Send and invoice Confirm drop "via" from the price line
  and open "Price and route" from Price impact (owner approved 2026-10-22).
  Warning and danger levels with real data, two cards and Android stay open.
- [ ] **TX-1.PRIVATE-SEND** Private (z) card sends in SendWizard (gap 7 of the
  2026-10-20 audit): private recipients and "name@:private", the Memo row and
  sheet, the sync block, the confirmed balance and the transparent-address
  notice (owner approved memo option A, sync option 1 and the notice on
  2026-10-22). Contract: `DESIGN.md`, Private card sends. QA on the public
  testnet; the private testnet turns the private card off.
- [x] **SV-1.TICKET-SHAPE** The gift card and the payment slips share one
  outline (20-point corners, round notches), the amount size (38 points on
  narrow or short windows) and a 20-point unit (owner, 2026-10-22).
- [x] **TX-1.3** Migrate source Card, destination network, and route sheets through
  SH-1. Preserve eligibility, selected values, balances, and route distinctions.
- [x] **TX-1.4** Migrate Address Book and self-address sheets. Retain search,
  network filtering, validation, and clear raw-address presentation.
- [x] **TX-1.5** Move fee breakdown to the shared information pattern. Keep fees,
  conversion estimates, and any uncertainty understandable and accurately labeled.
- [ ] **TX-1.6** Defer selection-triggered navigation and Address Book handoff
  until sheet closure completes. Verify back navigation retains valid form data.
  SH-1 implements the post-close callbacks; authenticated wizard back-navigation
  verification remains open in TX-1.
- [ ] **TX-1.7** Align amount, recipient, confirmation, processing, error, and
  result layouts. Reuse existing search, copy, skeleton, and safe-action controls.
- [x] **TX-1.I16** Exclude confirmed UTXOs spent by a mempool transaction from
  Send/Convert funding. Use fresh pending data, fail closed, and explain a
  resulting insufficient-funds error. Reuse the check for claim/identity funding.
- [ ] **TX-1.I16-QA** Orchestrator: verify two sends from the same address before
  confirmation, including the pending-balance message and retry after a block.
- [x] **TX-1.A33** Resolve token-only mempool spends from fresh verbose raw
  transaction inputs. Fetch each distinct spending transaction once. Keep the
  shared claim/gift-card check, fail-safe error, and pending-balance copy.
- [ ] **TX-1.A33-QA** Orchestrator: verify a pending USD send followed by a
  conversion, then retry after confirmation. Check the pending-balance message
  when the remaining unspent funds cannot fund the transaction.
- [x] **TX-1.I18** After a successful same-system VRPC conversion to the source
  Card's own address, activate the received currency through Manage assets.
  Share review's own-address check. Preserve Hidden choices and active assets.
  Keep metadata/storage work off the Success navigation path.
- [ ] **TX-1.I18-QA** Orchestrator: convert to an inactive USD/KMD/VRSC-USD
  asset on private Testnet. Check Home before and after settlement and restart.
  Check Hidden, already-active, other-recipient, export, and add-failure cases.
- [ ] **TX-1.8** Verify relevant direct send, conversion, cross-chain destination,
  no eligible route, insufficient funds, fee/preflight failure, processing, and
  result states. Preserve all Card/channel and transaction constraints.
- [ ] **TX-1.9** Complete relevant QA-1 checks and record delivery evidence.
- [x] **TX-1.A25-I26** Quote Ethereum export fees on Amount with the existing
  validated, zero-amount daemon simulation. Show one estimate row, skeleton,
  or unavailable value. Check amount plus source-currency fee before Continue.
  Reserve the fee for MAX. Keep Confirm's validated fee rows and final preflight.
- [ ] **TX-1.A25-I26-QA** Orchestrator: inspect fee loading/value/unavailable,
  insufficient funds, MAX, fiat MAX, route/amount changes, and Back from review
  on private Testnet. Check Android/iOS, light/dark, and normal/compact sizes.
- [x] **TX-1.A19** Clear prepared wizard steps after broadcast. Block a later
  submit with the existing context result and a synchronous success latch.
  Route Success hardware Back through Done (reset to Wallet home, unchanged);
  header Close keeps the shared exit to the opener. Keep the existing disabled inner swipe and hidden result back arrow.
- [ ] **TX-1.A19-QA** Orchestrator: verify Success exits on Android and iOS,
  including Back/swipe, Close, Done, and normal entry for a new send. Include
  direct send, conversion, and cross-chain paths when available.

- [x] **TX-1.REVIEW-SUCCESS** Fix A-5/I-7 fee-aware source balance, I-8
  visible amount reduction, A-6 complete fee text, A-7/I-12 scrollable Success
  and Android txid ellipsis, and I-16 explicit rejection copy. Preserve the
  ambiguous-broadcast state and transaction/preflight contracts.
- [ ] **TX-1.REVIEW-SUCCESS-QA** Orchestrator: verify direct send, token send
  with a system-currency fee, conversion, MAX, explicit rejection, unknown
  broadcast status, and Success scrolling/copy in Android/iOS light/dark at
  normal and compact sizes. Verify Back, retry, and Done behavior.

- [x] **TX-1.A21** Classify Ethereum export systems from the currency
  definition's `nativecurrencyid.type` with `DEST_ETH`. Keep explicit `ethdest`
  routes and the existing recipient, self-address, and preflight paths.
- [x] **TX-1.A22** Use the asset portion of an unknown currency's qualified
  name for its fallback ticker. The MKR.vETH network rows now say "Receive as MKR".
- [x] **TX-1.I16-A11** Refresh the source balance after a successful broadcast.
  Expire the source system's address-response caches. Include mempool deltas in
  VRPC totals and discovery snapshots. Keep an open wizard's balance current,
  and keep the entry route stable when a send empties its Card.
- [ ] **TX-1.I16-A11-QA** Orchestrator: compare Wallet, Asset detail, and a new
  wizard before confirmation. Repeat the same amount and recipient after a send.
  Check a full-balance send and unavailable-balance retry on iOS and Android.

- [x] **TX-1.A23** Share measured-header keyboard avoidance between Amount and
  Recipient. Keep the existing error message above the safe action footer.
- [x] **TX-1.A9** Reject asset input beyond the source coin's decimal precision
  before the existing amount rounding. Disable Continue and show the inline error.
- [x] **TX-1.A10** Resolve a VerusID name on Continue with the source system's
  existing identity helper. Show checking, not-found, and retry states. Ignore
  late replies after edit or navigation away. Preserve raw-address validation.
- [x] **TX-1.A12** Name the source network in the direct-send Amount subtitle.
- [x] **TX-1.POLISH** Map `bad-txns-inputs-missing` to recovery copy. Subtract
  only source-currency fees for a direct send to the selected channel's source
  address. Keep amount subtraction for conversion and cross-chain transfers.
  Separate review warnings with the shared spacing token. Keep form controls
  and errors in one scroll flow. Hide the save chip on Recipient errors.
  Restore current-step progress when a mounted header regains focus.
- [ ] **TX-1.POLISH-QA** Orchestrator: verify all six fixes on Android and iOS,
  in light/dark and normal/compact layouts. Check Amount and Recipient errors
  with the keyboard open/closed, MAX and save-chip visibility, conversion
  warning spacing, and Back from Confirm. No new device proof exists here.
- [x] **TX-1.A34** Reveal Amount/Recipient errors in the shared scroll layout
  after error and keyboard/viewport changes. Place errors next to their fields;
  retain MAX and secondary controls in normal flow and the safe action footer.
- [ ] **TX-1.A34-QA** Orchestrator: verify precision and bad-address errors
  with the keyboard open/closed on Android/iOS, light/dark, normal/compact.
  Confirm the field, full error, and footer are visible together. Check MAX,
  conversion estimates, error clearing, retry, Back, and keyboard reopening.
- [x] **TX-1.I13** Permit a valid R-address contact across currencies on its
  Verus network. Use the same context filter for the saved count and chooser.
- [ ] **TX-1.AmountRecipient-QA** Orchestrator: inspect Amount and Recipient on
  Android and iOS with the keyboard open/closed, light/dark themes, and normal/
  compact sizes. Check precision errors, identity lookup loading/error/retry,
  Back during lookup, source-network subtitle, and count/chooser agreement.
  No transaction broadcast is needed for these checks.
- [x] **TX-1.HISTORY** Preserve VRPC spend metadata and mempool timestamps.
  Group by transaction ID and prefer confirmed data on snapshot overlap. Label
  a single decoded conversion with its target currency in the existing row and
  detail Type slots. Retain the actual conversion recipient and stable VRPC row
  keys. Preserve net balance amounts and same-transaction import aggregation.
- [ ] **TX-1.HISTORY-QA** Orchestrator: check pending/confirmed history and detail
  opening, including I-21, in light/dark and normal/compact layouts. The local
  fixture does not reproduce the native C6 tap failure. The extra safe-area
  check flags the existing legacy modal `SafeAreaView` import on both the base
  and candidate; this copy-only change retains the modal shell.
- [x] **TX-1.HISTORY-TAP-DETAIL** Add a native no-touch wrapper to the signed-in
  edge fade. Keep the carousel, list, and gradient geometry. Preserve conversion
  currency case and use sheet theme colors for the dark detail header/actions.
- [ ] **TX-1.HISTORY-TAP-DETAIL-QA** Orchestrator: verify the newest row at
  several x positions, above and below the 32-point top fade boundary. Check
  scrolling, return to top, older rows, Card swipes/copy, sheet close/reopen,
  conversion Type, and enabled/disabled Details on iOS/Android in both themes
  and normal/compact sizes. The native interception cause has high source
  confidence; no new native execution ran in this worktree.

**Acceptance:** The active wizard uses the current stepped-task and sheet
patterns without obscuring source/destination networks, route choice, fees, or
recipient. Existing transfer restrictions and state transitions still hold.

## RX-1 — Receive and payment-request creation

**Sources:**
[ReceiveAssetsList](src/containers/Transfer/ReceiveAssetsList.js),
[ReceiveSubwalletSheet](src/containers/Transfer/ReceiveSubwalletSheet.js),
[ReceiveAssetDetails](src/containers/Transfer/ReceiveAssetDetails.js),
[receive.styles](src/containers/Transfer/receive.styles.js).

- [x] **RX-1.1** Trace Wallet/Asset entry, Card selection, address selection,
  supported-chain information, and payment-request generation separately.
- [x] **RX-1.2** Rename the Card selector’s misleading “Choose address” title to
  “Choose a card”. Keep network context visible and show a current selection when
  the invoking flow has one. Preserve the Card-to-address/channel relationship.
- [x] **RX-1.3** Remove duplicate address-selection headings and migrate Card,
  address, and supported-chain sheets through SH-1.
- [x] **RX-1.4** Use consistent identifier typography and shared copy feedback.
  Verify the full copied address and displayed QR belong to the selected Card
  and network; keep address distinctions required by the current channel.
- [x] **RX-1.5** Convert the amount/subject/settings/result payment-request flow
  into a full-screen stepped task with `ProgressHeader` and safe bottom actions.
  Inspect the current field rules before deciding which optional steps can be
  combined. Document any justified alternative before implementing it.
- [x] **RX-1.6** Add proper back navigation that preserves valid inputs. Make
  cancellation/re-entry deliberate; do not reset visible content mid-dismissal.
- [x] **RX-1.7** Preserve request amount, currency, subject, settings, QR encoding,
  and share semantics. Request creation must not be described as receiving money.
- [x] **RX-1.8** Verify empty/loading/error states, one/multiple Cards, applicable
  address types/networks, optional fields, keyboard layouts, back/cancel/reopen,
  generated request decoding, and result display with disposable fixtures.
- [x] **RX-1.9** Complete relevant QA-1 checks and record delivery evidence.

**Implemented design contract and data trace (2026-09-11):** Entry is Wallet →
`ReceiveAssetsList`, or Asset detail → `ReceiveAssetDetails` with
`{coinId, subWalletId}` from `SignedInCoinDetail`. `receiveCardsForCoin` filters
Cards by `WALLET_APP_RECEIVE` and an address channel; `getExplicitAddressRecords`
reads `activeAccount.keys[coinObj.id][card.api_channels[API_GET_ADDRESSES]].addresses`
with labels from `card.address_info`; the Card therefore owns the channel, the
channel owns the address list, and the copied address and receive QR are the same
selected record. Card network copy uses `getSubWalletNetworkLabel`. Supported
chains remain informational (`getSupportedNetworks`). Payment requests stay
separate in `generateReceiveInvoice`.

The design contract follows the canonical Gift Card stepped task: `ProgressHeader`,
20-point horizontal / 24-point top / 28-point bottom insets,
`theme.typography.headlineMd` (28/36) step title with a 22-point title-block gap,
one primary `SafeBottomActionStack` action per step, `FadedScrollView` content and
header back. RX-1.5 replaced the 90% attached payment-request sheet with
`ReceivePaymentRequestFlow`: conversion-eligible Cards use amount → optional
subject → conversion settings → result, non-conversion Cards keep amount → result
with the v0 QR and camera-roll save. Subject and settings stay separate steps.
RX-1.4 uses the established platform monospace convention for raw addresses
(`Menlo` on iOS, `monospace` on Android) while human VerusID names keep normal
type, and the details screen offers accurate loading/empty/error states with a
safe exit instead of an empty Card chooser. RX-1.6 keeps step inputs across back,
intercepts system back and removal gestures through `beforeRemove` to match the
header back, invalidates in-flight generation on cancel/unmount/context change,
single-flights creation and QR saving, and binds the result QR, amount, share
message and save source to the generated snapshot. A pending generation is never
a dead end: the header back and an explicit `Cancel` action both invalidate the
generation before leaving, and every QR save completion is bound to the request
and save operation that started it. RX-1.7 preserves the invoice contract,
including the subject being share-message only and not encoded in the modern
VerusPay invoice, and replaces raw RPC/file errors with concise recovery
guidance. No wallet permission, share or save is invoked automatically.

The amount step uses a normal editable `AppTextInput` driven by the system
`decimal-pad` keypad — the same native input and keyboard mechanism as the
slippage field — instead of the custom on-screen numeric keypad, which is
removed. The field keeps the currency beside it, the fiat estimate and the
fiat/coin switch, autofocuses on entry, and preserves the previous plain-decimal
input contract (digits and one locale decimal separator, 18-character ceiling) so
a paste such as `1e5` or `0x10` cannot validate into an unintended invoice. The
rest of the step machine, single-flight generation, save binding, cancel and
back handling are unchanged.

**Acceptance:** Users can distinguish choosing an Asset, a Card, and an address.
Simple choices use consistent sheets. Payment-request creation has understandable
steps, a working back path, and a result accurately tied to its generated data.

## RX-2 — Receive restyle

**Status:** Implemented and device-verified on 2026-10-20 (QR decoding open).
Owner approved 2026-10-20: Receive variation
A ("Calm address") and variation C's paper slip. Keep the current address field;
show the normal address or human VerusID name under the slip QR.

- [x] **RX-2.1** Remove the supported-chain claim and sheet. Show only the
  selected card type and network; open the existing card chooser from this line.
- [x] **RX-2.2** Apply the flat Receive layout, white QR tile, unchanged address
  rows, Share address, and secondary Request amount through the safe footer.
- [x] **RX-2.3** Combine request input into one step. Add Note and Conversions
  compact sheets with the Settings gate and existing slippage validation.
- [x] **RX-2.4** Add the fixed paper slip, compact QR, snapshot estimate and
  receiving address/name. Preserve invoice, share, save and operation guards.
- [x] **RX-2.5** Verify iOS and Android in light/dark, normal/compact sizes:
  keyboard, scroll, long amounts/notes, VerusID, non-conversion cards, copy,
  chooser, share/save failures, Back, cancellation and context changes.
- [ ] **RX-2.6** Compare rendered states with the approved mockups. Decode result
  QRs and verify the saved QR source. Inspect the iOS shadow and Android outline.

**Implementation evidence (2026-10-20):** Uncommitted work in the existing
`receive-restyle` worktree. Shared primitives: `ProgressHeader`, `FlatRow`,
`AppTextInput`, `SettingsSwitchRow`, `BottomSheetModal`, `useSheetDismissal`,
`StatusBadge`, `CopyAction`, `FadedScrollView`, and `SafeBottomActionStack`.
The approved HTML/images were inspected. Design (30 sources), safe-area (10
files), Babel parse (10 files), whitespace, and iOS/Android production bundles
pass. Configured ESLint cannot load `eslint-plugin-import` because
`./lib/util/glob-util` is not exported by ESLint; the isolated undefined/unused
name check passes. Temporary Node component fixtures pass input/result,
snapshot, single-flight, Back, context reset, stale sheet apply, decimal guard,
failure/retry, cancellation, and slippage validation. Source comparisons keep
address rows/styles, the invoice helper, error mapping, and operation handlers
unchanged. These checks do not prove native layout or QR decoding. No Metro
server, simulator, emulator, or live wallet action ran.


**Round-2 Android correction evidence (2026-10-20):** Based on `f624307d` in
`claude/receive-restyle`; changes stay uncommitted. The canonical Address book
Add sheet also hid Cancel behind Gboard. Android native dialogs already use
`adjustResize`; the shared `Modal` added a second, cached-height
`KeyboardAvoidingView`. The original Conversions sheet reproduces the hidden
Done button; switching only the Android wrapper to a flexible `View` resolves
it. iOS retains its padding avoider and offset. No keyboard metrics or timers
were added. Note and Conversions keep the full field and Done visible in light
and dark mode. Done applies values; close/reopen retains them. Invalid 101%
slippage keeps its error and Done visible. The request keypad keeps Create
request visible; a 1.25 VRSCTEST request reaches the result on private Testnet.
Address book passes Label/Address focus, Cancel, and reopen; the disposable
wallet unlock sheet also passes. Other native-sheet consumers were inspected
in source, not run: Coin Card picker, gift currency picker, PasswordCheck,
identity provisioning, GenericRequest identity linking, and Services identity
linking. Embedded sheets keep their existing wrapper.

Android address and VerusID rows disable selectable text so native middle
ellipsis works. Private (78-character z-address) and gETH (42 characters) pass
before/after checks; CopyAction copies the full Private address. The chooser
uses card types, retains a VerusID name, and shows a monospace transparent
address subtitle. Private/Transparent choice, balances, network group, selected
state, and accessibility labels pass on the device in light/dark mode.
Evidence: `/tmp/rx-fix/` (before/after PNGs and `keyboard-probe.log`). Design
contract (30 sources), safe-area (3 JS files), Babel parse (3), whitespace, and
production Android/iOS bundles pass. No Jest tests ran. Private testnet and
slippage editing are restored OFF; system night mode is restored OFF. No
new runtime, reinstall, Metro restart, staging, commit, push, or merge.
This pass does not establish iOS runtime behavior, compact-device behavior,
VerusID device rendering, multiple transparent-card rendering, TalkBack speech,
or native behavior of the six source-only shared consumers.

- [x] **ID-1.1** Trace automatic linking, manual fallback, and request-resume paths
  separately. Automatic discovery already uses the newer component; retain it.
- [x] **ID-1.2** Bring manual input, review, loading, error, and result into the
  current linking experience. Preserve network/ownership checks and the ability
  to inspect the resolved identity before completing any required confirmation.
- [x] **ID-1.3** Migrate pending-status and unlink sheets through SH-1. Make the
  useful refresh/retry action prominent and removal secondary where appropriate.
  Keep unlink distinct from on-chain revocation, deletion, or recovery.
- [x] **ID-1.4** Use `onClosed` for manual-modal handoff, pending selection cleanup,
  and any navigation that requires the sheet to finish closing. Retain error
  contents until dismissal ends and block conflicting actions while processing.
- [x] **ID-1.5** Refine the detail hierarchy: identity name, status, and network
  first; understandable authority/control information; secondary technical data
  progressively disclosed. Preserve important warnings and complete identifiers.
- [x] **ID-1.6** Replace copy-alert interactions in the touched details path with
  `CopyAction`. Account for other users of `VerusIdObjectData` before shared edits.
- [x] **ID-1.7** Remove the unconditional “No attestations linked” assertion unless
  backed by an actual result. Prefer omitting the unsupported section; adding a
  new attestation-loading feature is a separate scope decision.
- [x] **ID-1.8** Use stable loading treatment and readable retry guidance for
  linked-list/detail failures. Ensure a refresh failure is visible even when old
  identity data remains on screen; do not expose raw RPC errors as the main copy.
- [x] **ID-1.9** Consolidate the informational sheet where practical, remove
  repeated copy, use “VerusID” consistently, and label icon-only controls for
  accessibility. Preserve state-aware scrolling and overflow cues.
- [x] **ID-1.10** Verify no identities, several identities, long names, discovery
  empty/error, manual link validation, pending/failed status, details loading/error,
  copy feedback, and unlink cancellation. Verify security-sensitive mutations only
  in the authorized disposable Testnet setup.
- [x] **ID-1.11** Complete relevant QA-1 checks and record delivery evidence.

**Implementation (verified and review-ready; committed as `33865cab` and
locally integrated):** manual entry, validation, identity resolution, the
resolved-identity review, the linking loading state, and the actionable failure
now live inside the shared
`LinkExistingVerusIdSheet` instead of the legacy SendModal link flow. The manual
step reuses the compact-form composition from `AddressBookEditSheet`
(`AppTextInput` plus `SafeBottomActionStack`) and the review reuses
`InfoSheetSection` with the section builder exported from
`DeepLinkVerusIdDetailsSheet`, so both the signed-in VerusID service and the
GenericRequest identity picker share one experience. Resolution stays read-only:
automatic discovery still queries `getIdentitiesWithAddress` with the stored
Redux VRPC R-address, and manual resolution calls `getIdentity` on the sheet's own
chain and matches the result against the wallet's stored VRPC addresses for the
ownership check, so no seed, private key, or signing material is requested.
Active-status, network/system, duplicate-link, and primary-address ownership
checks run in the sheet and remain enforced by the existing parent link paths.
The linked result is the refreshed list entry or request selection that the
existing parent flow already performs, so automatic and manual linking end in the
same place instead of adding a second result surface.
The signed-in service links under a captured session scope and re-asserts it
after each awaited step, so a late completion from another account cannot mark a
link or close a newer sheet.

Pending status and unlink confirmation are now floating shared sheets driven by
`useSheetDismissal`: refresh/retry is primary, removal/unlink is
secondary/destructive, every control disables while processing, cleanup and
selection clearing happen in `onClosed`, request-resume navigation waits for the
status sheet to close, and `goBack` waits for the unlink sheet to close. The
unlink copy states that it only removes the local wallet association and does not
revoke, delete, recover, or change the VerusID on-chain. The signed-in details
screen consumes a new `presentation="signedInDetails"` variant of
`VerusIdObjectData`: the name is the screen title, status/network/identifiers lead
the rows, warnings and authority/control information follow, identity content and
the private address start collapsed, copy uses inline `CopyAction`, refresh
failure stays visible above stale-but-useful data, and the unsupported
“No attestations linked” section is gone. The informational sheet now composes
the shared `InfoSheet` (measured overflow cue included) with one definition line
instead of duplicating the “What is VerusID?” heading.

**Correction (session-bound linking and resumption, follow-up):** the first
candidate passed rendered-source review but failed independent high-risk review,
so the following corrections are part of the committed `33865cab` delivery. The
shared `LinkExistingVerusIdSheet` now captures a real wallet session scope
(account hash plus login epoch) for both automatic discovery and manual lookup,
re-checks it after every await and immediately before it hands a candidate to a
parent, invalidates discovery/resolution/review when the scope changes, and
carries immutable origin metadata on every candidate. The three parents
(`AuthenticationRequestInfo`, `AppEncryptionRequestInfo`,
`SignedInVerusIdService`) revalidate that the candidate's chosen primary
R-address belongs to the currently scoped account's VRPC address array for the
candidate chain in addition to the identity's own primary-address list, so a
candidate resolved for one account can never link into another even when both
share the same first R-address. `processVerusId` gained a backward-compatible
optional guard that is checked after the pending-request storage await and
immediately before every dispatch and navigation; the signed-in service supplies
the captured session plus a synchronous operation token, and both the retry and
READY-row resume paths are single-flight so a stale completion cannot dispatch,
navigate, reopen a fallback sheet, clear a newer operation, or attach an error to
a newer session. The unlink confirmation's queued `goBack` now re-checks the
immutable originating session and route/focus ownership at execution time (the
unlink token is deliberately not used, because `onClosed` bumps it first). A
pending-status sheet that becomes READY now closes so the READY row's guarded
Link action takes over, with truthful "Ready to link" copy if it renders before
closing. The remaining legacy Authentication manual fallback now routes into the
shared manual step with the request network and a prefilled FQN, and the touched
consumers no longer open the legacy SendModal link UI. `IdentityPickerSheet`'s
nested Back transition guards on the synchronous `linkBusyRef` instead of the
React `linkBusy` state so a same-frame Back cannot leave the link step.

**Correction (final lifecycle defects, follow-up):** the same independent
high-risk reviewer rechecked the corrected candidate, closed five findings, and
returned two reproduced P2 lifecycle defects, now corrected. First, the unlink
confirmation's delayed callback validated against `renderedSessionScopeRef`
(rewritten on every render), so after an account/session change the old callback
could validate against the new session and call `goBack`. The callback now
carries the immutable `requestContext.sessionScope` captured when the unlink
started, alongside the unchanged mounted, focused-route, and route-key checks;
the unlink token is still deliberately unused because `onClosed` bumps it first.
Second, the READY-resume single-flight flag was cleared only by the old
promise's `finally`, so an unresolved run left the component rejecting every
later READY action. `createVerusIdResumeOwner` in `verusIdFlowGuards.js` now
binds the in-flight flag and token to the owning session scope: an account-hash
or session-epoch change invalidates the old token and releases the gate
synchronously, while a stale `catch`/`finally` cannot reopen a fallback, attach
an error, navigate, or clear a newer run's gate. Both defects are covered by the
real queued-callback and handler behavior with deferred promises, each confirmed
to fail when its fix is reverted by mutation.

**Final verification (iOS fixture, rendered and native):** the committed final
candidate `33865cab` was compiled into a task-owned iOS release fixture bundle
from the actual candidate (26 assets) and exercised with synthetic disposable
VRSCTEST states on a normal 402x874 simulator and a compact iPhone SE, in light
and dark. Covered:
no identities, several identities, long names, discovery loading/empty/error, the
always-reachable manual fallback, manual validation/lookup/resolved review/
failure, processing single-flight with blocked dismissal/Back, pending
error/progress/READY actions, details loading/error/long values, separate
accessible `CopyAction` nodes with copied feedback, unlink cancellation/failure,
and the rebuilt final details spot check. Native QA found a manual-row clipping,
corrected before the final capture. The same and only independent Astra
high-risk reviewer returned READY with all original and follow-up findings
closed, against a complete before/after state guard (1,702 files, no exclusions,
identical). Parent-owned visual QA applied the canonical SH-1/onboarding
patterns at normal/compact and light/dark; because the user required exactly one
independent reviewer, no second design-adviser reviewer was added, and the
single reviewer explicitly applied `max-product-design-taste` while reviewing
the final renders. Proof limits: fixture data and API are synthetic and cannot
sign, spend, move funds, expose a real key, or prove live RPC or
authenticated-wallet behavior, and callback or session authentication is not
transaction or settlement proof; native proof is iOS only. Android runtime, full
VoiceOver/TalkBack, exhaustive text scaling/reduced motion, and authenticated
disposable-wallet mutation remain explicitly unverified follow-up, not implied
passes. Node was 22.18.0 because the requested 22.23.2 was unavailable; checks
used the canonical sibling `node_modules`, and no source depends on it.

**Acceptance:** Automatic and manual paths form one coherent experience. Details
and status are concise and truthful. Copy feedback is unobtrusive. Unlinking is
understandable and remains distinct from changes to the identity on-chain.

## ID-2 — VerusID list and page (light card, content v1, funds)

**Sources:**
[SignedInVerusIdService](src/containers/Services/ServiceComponents/VerusIdService/SignedInVerusIdService.js),

[getVerusIdFunds](src/utils/verusid/getVerusIdFunds.js),
[SendWizardSelectSource](src/containers/SendWizard/SendWizardSelectSource.js).

- [x] **ID-2.1** Mockup rounds 1–3 in `/tmp/vm-mock-vid` (not in the repo). The
  owner chose "D revised" and kept the @ tab icon (2026-10-22).
- [x] **ID-2.2** List: filled rows, two-color name, asset count, a status badge
  only when not active. No network pill and no count pill.
- [x] **ID-2.3** Page: light card, Receive and Send, Control, Content and Details
  rows, then Funds. Status uses `getInfo` for the chain tip. Unlink moves to ⋯.
- [x] **ID-2.4** Content v1 sheet: decoded values; encrypted values grouped under
  one neutral "Encrypted" badge and never decrypted. Details sheet: parent,
  addresses, last change; no explorer on testnet (fixes the old verus.io link).
- [x] **ID-2.5** A fund row opens the asset screen (main-stack `CoinMenus`) with
  the VerusID card selected; Back returns to the page.
- [x] **ID-2.6** Send from a VerusID: one asset opens Amount; several open Select
  asset with only that VerusID's cards and a "From <name>" band
  (`sourceIdentity` route param).
- [x] **ID-2.7** iOS QA, normal and SE, light and dark, with real testnet data.
- [x] **ID-2.10** Owner follow-up (2026-10-22): no i-address on the card (it is
  in Details), the name is copyable, and Receive, Send and Convert are the asset
  screen's icon buttons (`SignedInActionButtons`).
- [ ] **ID-2.8** Android QA (normal and 360x640).
- [ ] **ID-2.9** Move the seven request screens that still open the old
  `VerusIdDetailsModal` to the new view (separate task).

**Acceptance:** The page says each fact once. Funds are a list of assets, not one
coin. A fund opens its asset. Encrypted content is marked and never decrypted.

## AL-1 — App alerts and old Settings pickers (gap 4)

**Sources:**
[Alert](src/components/Alert.js),
[AcknowledgeSheet](src/components/AcknowledgeSheet.js),
[BottomSheetModal](src/components/BottomSheetModal.js),
[SettingsScaffold](src/containers/Settings/components/SettingsScaffold.js),
[SettingsFieldSheet](src/containers/Settings/components/SettingsFieldSheet.js).
The call-site audit is a local note (`alert-audit.local.md`, not in the repo):
303 calls; 140 cannot run, 26 repeat the screen, 75 belong on the screen, 18 are
confirmations, 39 errors stay.

- [x] **AL-1.1** Mockups (sheet, dialog, without an alert, pickers) in
  `/tmp/vm-mock-alert`. The owner chose the sheet, kept the Wyre row, chose a
  confirmation for slippage ("Turn on" / "Not now") and dropped the old
  conversion disclaimer (it was only in the unreachable `SendCoin`).
- [x] **AL-1.2** `createAlert` renders the acknowledgement sheet; the alert
  options (`cancelable`, `disabled`) work again; a button runs after the sheet
  closes; Android back runs the way out.
- [x] **AL-1.3** Settings, sign-in and onboarding: inline password and save
  errors, no success alerts the screen already shows, specific confirmations.
- [x] **AL-1.4** Settings pickers: key derivation and blocklist source use
  `SelectionSheet`; number, RPC server and blocklist fields use
  `SettingsFieldSheet`; display currency reuses the Home currency sheet.
  Fixed: a blocklist source pick no longer clears the list, and the RPC check no
  longer spins forever.
- [x] **AL-1.5** GenericRequest screens, invoice payment, VerusID provisioning,
  gift cards and Address Book move their checks onto the screen.
- [x] **AL-1.6** A closing native sheet no longer comes back after an alert.
- [x] **AL-1.7** iOS QA on iPhone 17 Pro (light and dark) and iPhone SE.
- [ ] **AL-1.8** Android QA, including the back button on an alert.
- [ ] **AL-1.9** Device checks that need a staged failure or a request: the
  request wallet gates, invoice inline errors offline, gift card removal reasons.
- [ ] **AL-1.10** Remove the unreachable legacy code and its 140 alerts (separate
  task, after the upstream sync).

**Acceptance:** A user meets an alert only when the screen cannot show the
answer. Every alert looks like the acknowledgement sheet and names its action.

## SV-1 — Services tiles and the fixed gift card screen

**Authority:** [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) sections "Services home", "Gift card
detail", "Confirmation", and the status badge rule. The user approved them on
2026-10-15. The mockups illustrate the rules; DESIGN.md wins when they differ.

**Mockups:** the artifact
`https://claude.ai/artifact/Fix3WydeV2fp1wkKw3RrXM` (private to the owner;
read it with the Artifact tool's `read` action) and the local copy
`docs/qa/sv1/mockup.html` in the main checkout (ignored by Git). Use the top
two sections: "Services tab" and "Gift card screen". "Earlier options" are
rejected options.

**Decisions (user, 2026-10-15):**

- The Services root uses the two-column tile grid. A tile shows no pending
  count and no dot.
- The gift card detail uses the fixed card (no flip).
- Status uses the tinted badge with no dot. Ready uses the success pair,
  Pending the warning pair, and Not funded, Shared, and Claimed the neutral
  pair. Today the list shows Redeemed in red; that changes to neutral.
- Visible text says "Claimed" instead of "Redeemed" and "Claim completed".
  Internal names stay: `GIFT_CARD_DISPLAY_STATUS_REDEEMED` and
  `status.state === 'redeemed'` do not change.
- A new display status, Shared, applies after the link left the wallet
  (`hasGiftCardBeenShared`). Precedence: Claimed, then Pending, then Shared,
  then Ready, then Not funded.
- List filters: All, Ready, Pending, Not funded, Shared, Claimed. The list
  summary drops its "Shared ·" prefix, because the badge says it.
- The first share of an unshared card (Share, QR code, or NFC) opens
  `AcknowledgeSheet` with `confirmLabel="Share"` and `dismissLabel="Not now"`.
  This replaces the permanent "Unfunded gift card" and "Shared from this
  wallet" notices. A shared card shares again without the sheet.
- The card shows a pending amount dimmed. Pending funding records store
  transaction IDs, systems, and VerusIDs; they may not store amounts. Trace
  `addGiftCardPendingFunding` and the `broadcastGiftCardFunding` results first.
  If no amount is recorded, show the pending VerusID names or "No contents
  yet", and keep the Pending badge. Never invent an amount.

**Preserve:** the share-attempt record and rollback in `runShareAction`, the
pending-funding share guard, single-use funding after a share or funding
attempt, cancel and remove checks, the NFC tap host, refresh, and the existing
`GiftCardOptionsSheet` cancel flow. These are behavior, not layout.

**Track A — Services tiles.** Own branch from `redesign`. Expected files:
`src/containers/Services/SignedInServicesHome.js`, `src/copy/signedIn.js`, and
a style module if the tile is reusable. Do not touch gift card files.

- [x] **SV-1.1** Replace the image rows with the tile grid from DESIGN.md
  "Services home". Remove the folded 3D image imports. Keep the navigation
  targets and the address count loading.
- [x] **SV-1.2** Tile lines: Gift cards shows its card count ("3 cards",
  "1 card"). Read the count from the gift card service data the way
  `GiftCardServiceOverview` loads it; trace the storage, do not guess. With no
  cards it shows "Send funds or IDs". Address book shows "{n} saved", or "Save
  addresses" when empty.
- [x] **SV-1.3** Icons: Lucide `Gift` and `BookUser` at 24 points
  (`lucide-react-native` is installed and used by the sheets).
- [x] **SV-1.4** Delete `services-gift-card-folded.png` and
  `services-address-book-folded.png` only if nothing else imports them.
- [x] **SV-1.5** Verify on the iOS simulators `Verus GR3 QA` and
  `Verus GR3 Compact` (iPhone SE), light and dark, with zero and several cards
  and addresses, and at a large text size. Run `check:design`,
  `check:safe-areas` on the changed files, and a Babel parse.

**Track B — Gift card screen.** Own branch from `redesign`. Expected files:
`GiftCardServiceOverview.js` (detail, list badge, filters, summary), a new
fixed card component, `GiftCardFlipCard.js` (delete when unused),
`src/utils/giftCard/giftCardPresentation.js` and its unit test, and a shared
status badge. Do not touch `SignedInServicesHome.js`.

- [x] **SV-1.6** Presentation: add the Shared display status, the "Claimed"
  label, and the card texts "No contents yet" and "Empty". Update the expected
  wording in `giftCardPresentation.unit.test.js`. This is a spec change from
  this decision list; record it in the log.
- [x] **SV-1.7** Move `GiftCardStatusBadge` to a shared status badge with a
  card variant that uses the dark-mode pairs. Use it in the list and on the
  card. Update the DESIGN.md "Status label" row.
- [x] **SV-1.8** Build the fixed card from the `GiftCardFlipCard` material and
  shape: name and badge on top, contents at the bottom, no flip, swipe hint,
  "VERUS GIFT CARD" label, or issued date. Delete `GiftCardFlipCard.js` when
  nothing imports it.
- [x] **SV-1.9** Rebuild the detail screen from DESIGN.md "Gift card detail":
  header with back, refresh, and ⋯; the card; the Share, QR code, and NFC
  tiles; the fact rows; the pending transaction row; the Not funded footer.
  Remove the notice boxes, the Contents and Funding addresses sections, and the
  "Gift card options" button. "Fund from another wallet" keeps its route
  (`openFunding(card, {startExternal: true})`).
- [x] **SV-1.10** Share confirmation: the first share of an unshared card goes
  through `AcknowledgeSheet` (`dismissLabel="Not now"`), then the existing
  `runShareAction` with `shareNative`, `navigateToQr`, or `shareNfc`. Start the
  share after `onAcknowledged`, so the sheet has finished closing.
- [x] **SV-1.11** ⋯ options: keep `GiftCardOptionsSheet` and its actions. Add
  "Share before funding" for a not-funded card, through the same confirmation.
- [x] **SV-1.12** List: badge colors, the six filters, and the summary without
  the "Shared ·" prefix.
- [x] **SV-1.13** Verify the five states with real taps on VRSCTEST, light and
  dark, normal and compact: Not funded (a new card), Pending (right after
  funding), Ready (after confirmation), Shared (share by QR code), and Claimed
  (claim from a second disposable profile or with deeplink-sim). Check the
  confirmation's Share, Not now, and outside tap. Run `check:design`,
  `check:safe-areas`, a Babel parse, and the gift card unit suites.
- [x] **SV-1.14** Run one independent, report-only review of the Track B diff
  against DESIGN.md, the mockup, and the preserved behavior. Resolve blocking
  findings before the merge.

Android follow-ups from the 2026-10-15 Android run (see its log row):

- [x] **SV-1.15** Pending "Funding transaction" row on Android: the ID wraps to
  a second line that is cut off, with no ellipsis. The `Text` combines
  `numberOfLines={1}`, `ellipsizeMode="middle"` and `selectable`; Android does
  not ellipsize selectable text. Show one line with a middle ellipsis on both
  platforms (`CopyAction` already copies the full ID).
- [x] **SV-1.16** Android hardware Back on the gift card detail closes the whole
  Gift cards screen and returns to the Services root. The detail is local state
  (`selectedCardId`) on the list screen, with no `BackHandler`. Back from the
  detail must return to the list, as the on-screen back arrow does. Older than
  SV-1.
- [x] **SV-1.17** On Android, React Native `Share.share` never reports a
  dismissal, so opening the system share sheet marks the card Shared even when
  nothing was sent, and the next share skips the confirmation. Decision (user,
  2026-10-15): keep this behavior, because the link may have left through Copy.
  No code change. Recorded in DESIGN.md "Gift card detail" (Sharing).

**Acceptance:** Each fact appears once on the gift card screen. Sharing is
visible without a gesture and asks once before the key leaves the wallet. The
Services root grows by one tile per service with no new artwork. Status uses
the badge without dots everywhere SV-1 touches. Preserved behavior still works.

## QA-1 — Completion criteria for each workstream

These criteria apply to each delivered scope. The overview’s QA-1 row becomes
Done only when all delivered workstreams have their applicable evidence. Until
then, record coverage per workstream in the log rather than claiming a global pass.

- [ ] **QA-1.1** Every completed workstream has a recorded design contract,
  implementation commit/candidate, touched paths, and acceptance outcome.
- [ ] **QA-1.2** Every redesigned surface has been compared with its canonical
  exemplar in light and dark mode at normal and compact sizes. Include relevant
  empty, selected, loading, error, keyboard, processing, and result states.
- [ ] **QA-1.3** Navigation, sheet dismissal/reopen, system back, reduced motion,
  safe areas, scrolling, labels/focus, and text scaling have applicable evidence.
  Do not infer accessibility compliance from screenshots alone.
- [ ] **QA-1.4** Relevant design, safe-area, parser/bundle, and behavior checks
  have passed or have precise documented limitations. Do not add new Jest tests
  unless the user explicitly asks; follow current repository validation guidance.
- [ ] **QA-1.5** Meaningful behavior changes have the required independent review,
  with reviewer selection based on actual changed risk. Resolve blocking findings
  and record the final candidate reviewed. Follow current AGENTS/skill procedures.
- [ ] **QA-1.6** Shared changes have checked affected existing consumers, especially
  authentication, Identity Update, invoice payment, and Card selection where used.
- [ ] **QA-1.7** Completion claims are supported by the right evidence: source,
  rendered UI, native behavior, response delivery, and transaction confirmation
  are recorded separately. Unverified platforms/states remain explicitly open.
- [ ] **QA-1.8** The final checklist and log reflect delivered Git state. Any
  known remaining issue has a task ID, clear next action, and owner or blocker.

Useful checks, selected for the actual change:

```sh
corepack pnpm check:design
corepack pnpm check:safe-areas <touched-ui-files>
git diff --check
```

The baseline design check protects 27 canonical sources. It does not scan every
screen for adoption and does not replace rendered QA. Add narrow mechanical
coverage only when a concrete recurring failure warrants it; do not turn this
plan into a repository-wide migration test project.

## Evidence and handoff log

| Date | Scope | Candidate / commit | Evidence and result | Remaining / next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-10-22 | GR-3.20: request loading screen for invoice, identity update and v1 login links | `claude/request-loading` from `84a2e37e`; `GenericRequestLoading.js` (title and steps props), `DeepLink.js` (one opening screen and error state for every request type, themed root), `GenericRequestHome.js` (themed root); DESIGN.md "Scanned payments and VerusPay invoices" | Design contract: `GenericRequestLoading` as is, with its own title and steps. iOS 26.5 "Verus Alerts QA", signed out, unsigned 0.01 VRSCTEST invoice link: "Opening invoice" with Read invoice, Select network and Prepare payment (no Verify signer), Cancel; then "Pay invoice". Light and dark. Cancel during loading returned to the sign-in screen. The public testnet server failed the invoice with 401 (placeholder key, environment); a temporary, reverted QA patch held each step 1.5 s and pinned `api.verustest.net` to reach the success path; the failure ends on the existing "Can’t open this invoice" sheet over the new screen. A GenericRequest link still shows "Opening request" with four steps and its error state ("Request expired", Close). Babel parse, `check:design`, `check:safe-areas --changed`, `git diff --check` pass; Jest `genericResponseNetwork` (4 tests) passes. | iPhone SE and Android not run; v1 login loading not run on a device (its error path was restored to the old alert after the device run, checked by source); identity update links are not routed by the link handler today (commented out), so their path was checked by source only; signed invoice not run. |
| 2026-10-22 | Gap 5: Home notification card A and secure task screen A | `claude/signout-card` from `1bdad73c`; `NotificationWidget.js`, `SecureLoading.js` (themed view, `SecureLoading.styles.js` removed), `MainStackScreens.js` and `SignedOutStackScreens.js` (no header, no swipe back), short task messages in the Settings callers; DESIGN.md "Home notification card" and "Secure task screen" | Design contract: Services tile fill and corners plus compact `AppButton` for the card (deviation: page-colored button on the gray card); `GenericRequestLoading` for the screen. iOS 26.5 "Verus GR3 QA" (`GR3 Test 2`, public testnet): the real failed card and a temporary QA "ready" card, light and dark; Lock wallet with a temporary 20 s task shows "Signing out" with the 7-bar loader (light) and the slow line with a temporary 3 s delay (dark). All QA patches reverted. `git diff --check`, `check:design`, `check:safe-areas --changed` pass. | iPhone SE and Android not run; the ready-card celebration is in a separate mockup round. |
| 2026-10-22 | Gap 5 follow-up: one-time celebration on the ready VerusID card (C without border) | `claude/ready-celebration` from `432e43a1`; new `VerusIdReadyCard.js` (Reanimated + react-native-svg: tint bloom, name rise, 12 confetti pieces, 2.2 s); `NotificationWidget.js` (ready cards use it, failed cards keep card A, `celebrated` flag saved on the stored notification); DESIGN.md "Ready card celebration" | Owner chose C from three animated mockups, then removed the traced border after seeing it in the app. Design contract: card A layout and button, card-only material like the gift card. iOS 26.5 "Verus GR3 QA" (`GR3 Test 2`, public testnet) with a temporary QA "ready" notification: plays in light and dark; a relaunch and a tab switch show the still card; Reduce Motion shows a fade only. QA patch reverted and the QA notification removed. `git diff --check`, `check:design`, `check:safe-areas --changed`, Metro bundle pass. | iPhone SE and Android not run; no real provisioning run (the ready state came from the QA notification). |

Wallet creation showed no "Wallet created!" alert. Babel parse, `check:design`, `check:safe-areas` (60 files), iOS bundle build pass. Related Jest suites: the same 28 fail as on `redesign` (existing failures); `profileDeletion`, `passwordMigration`, `authDataStorage`, `fundRawTransactionError`, `convertOrCrossChainSendConfirm` pass after their copy and mock updates. | Android QA; request, invoice and gift card states that need staged failures; legacy-code removal. |

Owner chose mockup A and removal at any balance (spam currencies). A row tap opens the asset sheet; "Remove from wallet" confirms in `AcknowledgeSheet`, then runs the existing `removeExistingCoin` teardown and stores a per-network `removed` mark that automatic adding and "New assets found" respect; adding the asset again clears it. Review asset for a found currency gains "Ignore". The main coin has no sheet. The iOS 26 switch is scaled to 51 x 22.7 pt (owner found 63 x 28 too large). iOS 26.5 sim "Verus GR3 QA" (PTest iOS, Testnet): sheet, Not now, removal of VRSC-USD (balance 0.19987077) with the row gone at once, no return in "New assets found" after more than ten minutes and an app restart, Ignore on found KMD (gone, still gone after restart), VRSC-USD added again through Add custom asset with its balance, main-coin row opens nothing; light and dark; switches measure 51.0 x 22.7 pt in Manage assets (right edge 381.7 pt) and General settings (380 pt), off state clean.

Rounds P/E/R/S/T/F: Network fee row, Slow/Normal/Fast sheet, Custom fee (errors, low and high warnings, keyboard), reset to Normal per Confirm, MAX, light/dark. Real sends 0.001 gETH Slow/Fast/Custom (`0xab0f4789…`, `0x735d71da…`, `0xaafc8275…`) and 0.01 gETH Normal (`0xf97916ff…`): on-chain maxFeePerGas/maxPriorityFeePerGas match the chosen tier or custom values. Bridge both ways (VRSCTEST to Ethereum, gETH to Verus) keeps "Fees ›". QA found F7, F8, D1, D2, D3; fixed in `433033f4`, `59e2d637`, `65e5b039` and re-verified. Sepolia charged 204,600 gas for the first send to an empty address; the estimated gas limit handled it. On Sepolia Fast equals Normal (uniform 1 gwei tips). | ERC-20 (no Sepolia token), BTC (no testnet coin; owner deferred), Android 360dp and the "Try again" footer remain untested.

| 2026-10-21 | TX-1.FEE-CHOICE: SE D3 field reachability | `claude/fee-choice` from `c8375787`; `NetworkFeeSheet` | Move the warning and summary below the fields in scroll content. Keep only Use this fee in the safe footer. Retain top/end focused-field scrolling and layout/content-size callbacks; warning changes also trigger reveal. Remove the unused footer wrapper/style. Shared selection/scroll changes from `59e2d637` remain in use for reveal, native indicators and tier subtitle width; no shared files change. SE source estimate at 375x667, keyboard 235 and top inset 20: maxHeight 392; shell/body/header overhead 94; action 56; scroll viewport 242, versus 168 with the summary pinned or 142 with a warning too. A field is 108 (19 label + 8 gap + 56 input + 7 gap + 18 helper/error). Base plus the full Priority box ends at 211, or 229 with a two-line base error. Priority/helper, one-line warning, summary and bottom padding need 212 at scroll end. Non-Jest source/layout checks reproduce 3 failures before and pass all 6 after. The same five existing Jest suites pass before and after: 81 tests. Design (30 sources), safe-area (one JS file), repo-config Babel parse (one file), and whitespace checks pass. | Estimates and source checks only. Supplied T6, T2 and S4 screenshots inspected read-only; no new native/rendered evidence. Orchestrator owns SE and larger-phone light/dark focus, warning/error transitions, tap reachability and Back/dismiss/reopen QA. Metro 8083 and simulators left untouched. No push or merge. TX-1.FEE-CHOICE stays open. |

Show "This fee is much higher than Fast." only for a valid custom fee above twice Fast. ETH compares `min(maxFeePerGas, baseFeePerGas + maxPriorityFeePerGas)` for both choices with the quote's base fee. BTC compares sat/vB. All comparison arithmetic uses BigInt. Invalid inputs, field errors and fallback quotes show no warning. Low and high warnings share one slot; Confirm is unchanged. The same five existing Jest suites pass before and after: 81 tests. Design (30 sources), safe-area (two JS files), repo-config Babel parse (two files), and whitespace checks pass. Temporary Node comparison checks pass all 29 cases, including exact/above-threshold boundaries, both ETH caps, large integer precision, high Max base alone, BTC rates, invalid fields and missing tiers. Temporary check removed before commit. | Source and Node helper evidence only. No new rendered, native, live-provider or chain evidence. Owner must check ETH/ERC-20 and BTC in light/dark, normal/compact sizes, keyboard open/closed, high/low/error/fallback states, enabled Use this fee, Back/dismiss/reopen, and absence of the warning on Confirm.

| 2026-10-21 | TX-1.FEE-CHOICE: SE D1/D2 layout fixes | `claude/fee-choice` from `433033f4`; `NetworkFeeSheet`, shared selection/scroll primitives and selection styles | Keep the canonical sheet, `AppTextInput`, safe action stack and 56-point row minimum. Custom pins the warning and summary outside the scrolling fields. Focus, input, viewport and content-size changes reveal the active field. Only this form requests the native indicator while typing, so the fade cannot cover helpers. Opt-in tier rows retain the subtitle's intrinsic width; complete fee amounts can wrap. Shared defaults and `keyboardDismissMode="on-drag"` stay unchanged. Temporary synthetic component checks against the base: 30 pass/22 fail; candidate: 52 pass/0 fail. The same five existing Jest suites pass before and after: 81 tests. Design (30 sources), safe-area (four changed JS files), repo-config Babel parse (four files), and whitespace checks pass. Temporary check removed before commit. | Source and synthetic component evidence only. The supplied five QA screenshots establish the defects; no new native/rendered verification. Owner must check SE 375x667 in both themes: Priority `0.0001`/`abc`, base/rate focus, helper/error/warning/summary/action visibility, all six tier arrival subtitles and full amounts, Back/dismiss/reopen. Metro 8083 and attached simulators are left untouched. No push or merge. |
| 2026-10-21 | TX-1.FEE-CHOICE: F7/F8 device-QA fixes | `claude/fee-choice` from `bc3d8045`; Confirm, `networkFeeUtils`, `NetworkFeeSheet` | Confirm uses `previewNetworkFee` with the current fee and the last matching review after failed preflight. ETH uses estimated gas; BTC uses estimated byte size. Fee caption and arrival require a computable fee. Balance, MAX and submission guards are unchanged. Non-empty invalid ETH fields show their own `AppTextInput` error; empty fields stay silent. Floor error and low-fee warning remain. Temporary Node source-expression and synthetic React checks: 17 pass/21 fail before, 38 pass/0 fail after. Existing Jest baseline across two runs and final run pass the selected five suites: `electrumTransactionFlow` (23), `ethSendResponseLoss` (12), `erc20BridgePreflight` (39), `traditionalCryptoSend` (3), `traditionalCryptoSendConfirm` (4), 81 tests before and after. Design (30 sources), safe-area (3 JS files), repo-config Babel parse (3 files), and whitespace checks pass. Temporary checks removed before commit. | No new rendered/native or chain evidence. `agent-device open` returned `DEVICE_IN_USE` for the attached simulator; its existing session was preserved. Metro 8083 serves this worktree and stays running. Orchestrator must recheck F7/F8 on device, including light/dark and compact layouts. No push or merge. |
| 2026-10-20 | TX-1.FEE-CHOICE: owner-approved variation A | `claude/fee-choice` from `e8992c94`; Confirm, `NetworkFeeSheet`, `useNetworkFee`, fee helpers, shared selection/input primitives, ETH/ERC-20 plain preflight/send, Electrum size metadata, BTC rate sources, `DESIGN.md` | Contract: A0/A1/A2 mockups, canonical `FlatRow`/`SelectionSheet`/`SelectionRow`, `AppTextInput`, `useSheetDismissal`, `SkeletonLoader`, and Address Book keyboard-aware form composition. Plain ETH/ERC-20/BTC only; Normal is local to each send. ETH display uses estimated gas times capped base-plus-priority; balance/MAX retains the maximum, and signing retains the exact gas limit and both confirmed prices. BTC uses validated integer rates from mempool.space then blockchain.com, with timeouts, the existing rate limit, and Custom/retry recovery. Preflight changes retain the review and reject stale results and Hold callbacks. Base source fixtures reproduce the doubled ETH fee and undefined BTC expected fee. Temporary non-Jest checks pass: 69 fee/rate/custom/preflight cases; 20 offline signed ETH/ERC-20 envelope and rejection checks; 37 synthetic Confirm cases; 15 synthetic sheet cases. Required existing Jest suites pass on base and candidate: 5 suites, 81 tests each. Repo-config Babel parse passes for all 20 changed/new JS files; design (30 canonical sources), safe-area (all 20 JS files), and whitespace checks pass. Temporary scripts removed before commit. Review round 1 on `16f16c83`: F1 removes all per-tier preflights; sheet values use `previewNetworkFee` from the review gas/byte-size metadata, BTC rows show an approximate value, and missing reviews use the shared skeleton value slot. F2 replaces the extra secondary retry with one normal-press primary "Try again" only for a failed quote without a valid fee; other preflight errors keep the pinned message and Hold stays disabled. F3 uses half the Normal tip for a zero Slow median, with a 1-wei minimum and ordered positive tiers even for all-zero rewards. F4 rounds nonnegative blockchain.com rates up to at least 1 sat/vB before existing ordering/limit validation; mempool.space stays primary. F5 adds 16-point right accessory spacing, disables accessory interaction/accessibility, and includes units in the three Custom field labels. F6 uses the canonical lucide `ChevronLeft` at size 22 in `textPrimary`. Temporary non-Jest Node checks reproduce 14 failing cases before the fixes and pass all 21 cases after, including sheet open/reopen preflight counts, fee selection, quote retry, insufficient funds, valid Custom recovery, local ETH/BTC arithmetic, rate rejection, input labels/spacing, and Back. This round passes the same 5 existing Jest suites (81 tests), design (30 sources), safe-area (7 changed JS files), repo-config Babel parse (all 7), and `git diff --check`. Temporary script removed before commit. | Source, synthetic React and offline signing evidence only. No Metro, simulator, emulator, device, live fee-provider or chain transaction runs. Orchestrator must verify Sepolia ETH and ERC-20, BTC tiers/custom/source failure/retry/MAX, rapid changes, bridge and fixed-fee/Verus regressions, iPhone SE 375x667 and Android 360x640, normal sizes, light/dark, keyboard/back/dismiss/reopen. Review round 1 adds source and synthetic component evidence only; no rendered/device or live-provider runs. Task stays open until device QA. No push, merge or PR. |

| 2026-10-20 | RX-2 round 2 Android fixes | `claude/receive-restyle` from `f624307d`, uncommitted; `Modal.js`, `ReceiveAssetDetails.js`, `ReceiveSubwalletSheet.js` | Canonical Address book and Conversions reproduce keyboard-hidden actions. Android native dialog resizing replaces the duplicate height avoider; iOS keeps padding avoidance. Note/Conversions light/dark, Done/apply, close/reopen, invalid slippage, request keypad and private-Testnet request result pass on Pixel 8 API 35. Private/gETH middle ellipsis and full Private copy pass. Chooser types, address subtitle, balances, selection, network group and accessibility labels pass. Address book and unlock pass as shared consumers. Design, safe-area, parser, whitespace and Android/iOS production bundles pass. Before/after evidence: `/tmp/rx-fix/`. | Private testnet, slippage editing and night mode restored OFF. No Jest, staging, commit, push, merge, reinstall or Metro restart. iOS/compact runtime, VerusID/multiple transparent cards and six other native-sheet consumers remain unverified at runtime.

| 2026-10-20 | RX-2 device QA and fixes | `claude/receive-restyle` `9953ff89`, `f624307d`, `17b93ca3`, `d76642e8`, `9b2aedc5` | Sonnet 5.5 device QA against the approved mockups. iOS 17 Pro (PTest iOS): 14/17 pass, then fixes. iPhone SE (PTest SE): SE1–SE8 pass after the width-fitted amount and no slip fade. Android Pixel 8 API 35 (disposable "RX QA Android"): R1–R16, then A1–A5 pass after round 2, including Address book, unlock, VerusID manual link and gift-card currency search as shared-modal consumers. Android 360x640 (PTest A360): C1–C6 pass after the 640-point compact Receive layout and the slip amount fit. Fixed: long amounts, stale slippage error, saved-QR label, Android sheet keyboard, Android long-address ellipsis, chooser labels, dark slip fade, 360 dp address overlap, slip unit larger than the amount. Evidence (ignored): `docs/qa/receive-restyle/`. | Open: RX-2.6 QR decoding with a scanner; VerusID card and multiple transparent cards not available in the test wallets; no fiat price on testnet (chip unverified). App-wide follow-ups, not RX-2: no `keyboardAppearance` for in-app dark mode; iOS 26 `SettingsSwitchRow` switch overruns the content edge; public testnet invoice creation fails (API key), so the private-testnet switch was used. |
| 2026-10-20 | App-wide: iOS keyboard follows the in-app theme | `claude/keyboard-appearance` from `907e7914`; `App.js`, new `src/utils/applyThemedKeyboard.js`, `DESIGN.md` | Closes the RX-2 follow-up "no `keyboardAppearance` for in-app dark mode". One start-up patch gives every iOS `TextInput` (React Native, `AppTextInput`, `AppSearchField`, Paper) `keyboardAppearance` from the theme context unless the field sets its own. iOS 26.5 sim "Verus GR3 QA" (PTest iOS, Testnet): app Dark + phone Light gives a dark keyboard in Send search, Request amount number pad and the Note sheet; app Light + phone Dark gives a light keyboard; app System follows the phone. Evidence (ignored): `docs/qa/keyboard-appearance/`. Design check passes; ESLint does not start in this checkout (existing setup failure). | Android ignores `keyboardAppearance`; Gboard and other keyboards follow their own or the system theme. No legacy Paper field was opened on device; it renders the same React Native `TextInput`. |
| 2026-10-20 | App-wide: iOS 26 switch size; onboarding bottom action above the keyboard | `claude/app-wide-followups` from `1a4232dc`; new `src/utils/applyNativeSwitchSize.js`, `App.js`, `manageAssets.styles.js`; `AndroidKeyboardAvoidingForm.js` moved to shared `src/components/KeyboardAvoidingForm.js` (`WizardUI` uses it); `ChooseName`, `CreatePassword`, `SeedWords`, `ImportText`, `ImportSeed`; `DESIGN.md` | Switch: React Native 0.77 lays out iOS switches as 51 x 31 pt; the iOS 26 switch draws 63 x 28 pt and ran 12 pt past the row edge (measured). A start-up patch gives `Switch` 63 x 28 on iOS 26 or later; Manage assets' fixed 52 pt slot becomes a minimum width. iOS 26.5 sim "Verus GR3 QA": General settings switches end at 380 pt (content edge, was 392 pt); Manage assets ends at 382 pt (search field edge), off state clean; toggling works; light and dark. Keyboard: on Android the onboarding forms had no keyboard avoidance (`KeyboardAvoidingView` with no Android behavior under `adjustPan`), and on windows taller than 667 pt the name and password steps had none on either platform, so Next sat behind the keyboard (reproduced on the unchanged bundle: iPhone 17 Pro name step; Pixel 8 name step, where a tap on Next hit a key). The five steps now use `KeyboardAvoidingForm`; the taller name and password layouts drop the bottom inset while the keyboard shows; the taller password form scrolls; password and verify scroll the field and its error into view above the action. Pixel 8 API 35: Next/Next word/Create wallet/Import 8 dp above the keyboard on name, password, verify and import text; Next tapped with the keyboard open advanced the step; a disposable testnet wallet "KB QA Android" was created end to end. Small_360x640: name and verify pass. iPhone 17 Pro: name and password (with mismatch error) pass; closed-keyboard layout unchanged. Evidence (ignored): `docs/qa/app-wide-followups/`. | Not run on device: Send wizard after the component move (no funded testnet wallet on the emulator; same component and props), iOS verify step (the simulator stopped showing the software keyboard after automated input), iPhone SE. Existing, not changed: Android Import Secret Recovery Phrase entry pans the whole window up so the header sits under the status bar (same on the unchanged bundle). |
| 2026-10-17 | TX-1 round 6 Amount polish: A-35/I-36, I-37, A-36 | `claude/fix-amount-step-polish` from `0ae03b0f`; `SendWizardAmount.js`, `WizardUI.js` | Contract: keep the canonical Send wizard, existing amount field, error slot, semantic theme roles, and normal-flow `WizardFooter`/`SafeBottomActionStack`. When the source pays the Ethereum fee and Available is at or below it, show “Not enough VRSCTEST for the Ethereum network fee (about X VRSCTEST).” as soon as the quote arrives, before amount errors. Disable and dim MAX; its handler leaves the input unchanged. Funded MAX still subtracts the exact fee. Context uses the destination row's `name` and the route's `networkName`, including Ethereum and Bridge.vETH. The network sheet's ticker-based “Receive as …” wording stays unchanged (I-25). Source diagnosis for compact keyboard clipping: caller bottom padding is only 12 points on Amount and 20 on Recipient, with no footer-sized scroll reserve. `WizardFormLayout` now measures its non-shrinking footer and adds its height plus 24 points of keyboard-only end padding after caller styles. Keyboard avoidance, normal-flow Continue, and F14 error-reveal calculation stay unchanged. Temporary non-Jest React checks: baseline 3 pass/6 fail; candidate 9 pass/0 fail for fee boundaries, exact/fiat MAX, copy, other fee currencies, quote failure, measured reserve, keyboard-close reset, and F14 scrolling. Babel parse with repo config (two JS files), design (30 canonical sources), safe-area (two files), option matrix, and whitespace checks pass. Temporary dependency link removed before commit. | Source and synthetic React component evidence only; native clipping cause and rendered result still need device confirmation.

| 2026-10-17 | TX-1 owner-approved wizard header titles | `claude/wizard-header-title` from `78ebe3c7`; header, navigator, five steps, `WizardUI`, `DESIGN.md`, design check | Contract: match `ProgressHeader` title treatment with `titleSheet`, one line, tail ellipsis, header accessibility role, and semantic text color between symmetric 40-point controls/spacer. Titles: Select asset, Convert to, Amount, Recipient, Confirm. Progress stays below the row. Remove large content titles and unused `WizardHeading`; keep Amount asset/network/route context, remove repeated Recipient/Confirm subtitles, and retain missing-selection errors. Content starts at 24 points on normal/compact devices; keep the existing 16-point horizontal inset. Owner approval on 2026-10-17 revises the canonical stepped-task rule; Gift Card fund is not migrated. The design check first rejected its stale headline requirement; it now enforces the approved header-title rule. Design (30 canonical sources), safe-area (eight source files), option matrix, Babel parse (nine changed JS files using repo config), and whitespace checks pass. Exact source comparison confirms `WizardFormLayout` (F14 error scrolling/keyboard handling) and Success are unchanged.

After Success navigation, reuse `addManagedAsset` with `automatic: true` for an own-address VRPC conversion. Require matching route/definition system and source network; exclude exports and preserve Hidden. The submit fixture fails on the baseline and passes five scheduling/failure groups. Twenty-five non-Jest fixture groups cover activation, manual storage equivalence/readback, hidden/active assets, route/network guards, session changes, add failures, own-address matching, and pre-settlement zero balances. Native/authentication, RPC, and storage boundaries use fixtures. Read-only private RPC confirms USD, KMD, and VRSC-USD definitions belong to VRSCTEST. Babel parse (three files), design (30 sources), safe-area (three files), option matrix, and whitespace checks pass. | Orchestrator owns device, live conversion, settlement, and restart proof on private/public Testnet.

Add one fee row for VRPC Ethereum export routes only. The helper uses preflight's `getCurrencyTransferIntentContext`: currency definitions plus a zero-amount `sendcurrency` simulation with `returntx=true`, source public-hash Ethereum placeholder, and explicit source refund. It validates both quoted fee legs and adds the shared 0.0001 parent fee. Requests debounce 280 ms, time out after 15 s, bind to route/amount, and ignore late replies. Private-chain amounts 0.01/0.05/1 all yield 17.34138058 VRSCTEST including parent; the executed app preflight gives the same “at least” fee with an empty-balance boundary fixture. Mainnet amounts 0.01/0.05/1 all yield 12.15562225 VRSC. A second Ethereum address and Bridge.vETH export have the same fee on each chain. These are current snapshots, not the earlier 20.81 QA price. A private daemon candidate with synthetic funding passes the installed validator; unmodified Confirm fee mapping includes both legs and parent. Temporary non-Jest component fixtures reproduce baseline MAX, then pass loading/value/failure, funds blocking, exact and fiat MAX, late route replies, debounce, token-source fees, small fees, conversion rows, and missing-selection cases. Babel parse with repo config (4 files), design (30 canonical sources), safe-area (4 files), option matrix, and whitespace checks pass. | Source, component fixtures, and read-only daemon evidence only.

| 2026-10-17 | A-33: pending token-only funding inputs | `claude/fix-pending-token-spends` from `70bb06c8`; `getAddressUtxos.js`, `getTransaction.js` | Verus 1.2.18 source emits previous outpoints only for a negative native delta. Installed client types mark both fields optional. Private Testnet RPC returns 12 real UTXOs and a USD transaction with two `vin` records (`txid` string, `vout` integer), including one zero-native input. The live address mempool was empty. The Node fixture reproduces the baseline failure, then passes 13 cases: token-only spend leaves 11 UTXOs, duplicate deltas fetch once, all vins are excluded, distinct transactions fetch once each, empty/incoming-only mempools make no raw reads, mined transactions remain usable with a lagging index, and unreadable data fails closed. The shared funding wrapper retains its exclusion count. Babel parse (two files), design (30 sources), and whitespace checks pass. Existing preflight copy and claim/gift-card callers are unchanged. | Source, read-only RPC, and synthetic pending data only. Orchestrator owns A-33 device QA and confirmation/retry checks.

Reuse measured stack-header keyboard avoidance. Deliberate deviation: place errors directly after their fields, before secondary controls, with an 8-point error margin; remove the Recipient field's extra bottom gap only during errors. Both steps use the same measured error slot and scroll to `max(0, errorBottom - viewportHeight)` after layout. Pending frame cleanup prevents scrolling after unmount. Supplied Android 214/216 and iOS 308/311/315 captures inspected read-only. A temporary non-Jest component check fails on the baseline and passes on the candidate for error insertion, viewport resize, wrapping, keyboard close, clearing, and unmount. Babel parse (three JS files), design (30 sources), safe-area (three files), option matrix, and whitespace checks pass. Worked assumptions: 360x640 Android, drawable height 616, header 110, keyboard 280, open footer 80 gives a 146-point viewport; 402x874 iPhone 17 Pro, header 148, keyboard 336, footer 80 gives 310. Amount field plus one-line error needs about 108 points; a two-line Recipient field plus one-line error needs about 141. Values are layout examples, not device measurements. | Source and synthetic component evidence only. Orchestrator owns rendered QA, actual keyboard/inset measurements, long/wrapped errors and text scaling, and checks that each field/error pair fits.

Retain the wizard's existing 16-point content inset and custom close header; no broader redesign. Supplied defect shots and canonical Gift Card normal-light/compact-dark captures inspected read-only. Temporary non-Jest source/React fixtures reproduce rejection, self-send, chip, scroll-flow, and mounted-header Back failures on the base. Candidate checks pass. Worked examples with balance 12.29551078, amount 0.01, and source fee 0.0001 show `Balance after: 12.29541078 VRSCTEST` for direct self-send and `Balance after: 12.28541078 VRSCTEST` for conversion-to-self. Babel parse (five files), design (30 canonical sources), safe-area (five files), option matrix, and whitespace checks pass. | Source and synthetic component evidence only. Orchestrator owns new rendered QA in both themes, both platforms, normal/compact sizes, and keyboard/error/Back states. No changes to transaction construction, daemon fee parameters, signing, or preflight. No Metro, devices, broadcast, merge, or push actions. TX-1.8/TX-1.9 remain open. |
| 2026-10-17 | TX-1 Confirm/Success: A-5/A-6/A-7, I-7/I-8/I-12, I-16 rejection text | `claude/fix-wizard-review-success` from `a1e758fd`; `SendWizardConfirm.js`, `SendWizardSuccess.js` | Balance subtracts exact preflight fees only when the fee currency matches the sent currency ID. Direct VRPC uses `fee`/`feeCurr` in coin units; conversion/cross-chain uses `validation.fees` in satoshis, which includes transfer and network fees. The reduction notice sits under the amount. Fees wrap without rounding or ellipsis. Success uses canonical Gift Card `FadedScrollView` plus existing `WizardFooter`/`SafeBottomActionStack`; txid uses middle ellipsis and `CopyAction`. Theme title roles remain. Scoped deviations: retain existing Confirm/result summary styling and 24-point result side inset; no wider redesign. Source fixture execution reproduces the baseline balance defects and passes 9 balance cases, 14 daemon rejection cases, 5 explicit/unknown failure cases, and 4 Success component-shape checks. Babel parse (2 files), design (30 canonical sources), safe-area (2 files), option matrix, and whitespace checks pass. Read-only inspection covered supplied QA screenshots and canonical Gift Card normal-light/compact-dark captures. | Orchestrator owns all new rendered/device evidence: Android/iOS, light/dark, normal/compact, long fees, conversion scrolling/helper/txid, full-ID copy, MAX notice, rejection retry/Back, and unknown-status behavior.

| 2026-10-17 | Amount/Recipient: A-23/I-9, A-9/I-11, A-10/I-10, A-12/I-14, I-13 | `claude/fix-wizard-amount-recipient` from `a1e758fd`: `WizardUI.js`, `SendWizardAmount.js`, `SendWizardRecipient.js`, `AddressBookSheet.js`, `addressBook.js` | Contract: touch Amount/Recipient only; retain Gift Card keyboard/action composition, `SafeBottomActionStack`, `WizardFooter`, `ErrorMessage`, selection sheets, and theme typography. Intentional change: pin validation above Continue and use the measured stack-header height on both platforms. Required states are keyboard open/closed, precision error, identity checking/not-found/retry, late replies after edit/Back, and saved count/list agreement. Temporary non-Jest source fixtures: 12 pass; 9 fail against the base commit. Five keyboard layout/arithmetic checks pass for normal/compact iOS/Android and keyboard dismissal; these are synthetic, not rendered evidence. The existing RPC client produces `getidentity` with params `["nobodyqa123@"]`; both the user-specified request and this exact serialized shape return code -5 (Identity not found) from the private daemon. Babel parse (five JS files), design check (30 canonical sources), safe-area check (five JS files), send-wizard option matrix, and diff whitespace check pass. `pnpm` initially tried automatic installs in this worktree; stopped, then ran checks with `pnpm_config_verify_deps_before_run=false`. No tracked dependency files changed. | Orchestrator owns rendered/device verification in both themes and sizes, including keyboard clearance under Android adjustPan. No Metro, device, simulator, emulator, native changes, signing, or broadcast. Broader TX-1 verification stays open. |
| 2026-10-17 | I-16/A-11: balance after broadcast | `claude/fix-balance-after-broadcast` from `a1e758fd` | Two temporary non-Jest reproductions fail before the fix: confirmed-only VRPC total and frozen wizard balance. Six focused fixture groups pass after the fix: signed native/reserve deltas, live wizard balance, system cache expiry and network/storage races, existing channel/reducer/session guards, empty-Card entry stability, and success-only refresh scheduling. Read-only ptestapi reports Testnet, height 33629, 12.59656078 VRSCTEST, no address mempool entries, and eight UTXOs. Transaction construction and signing stay unchanged. Babel parse, design contract, and safe-area checks pass. | Source, React renderer, mocked network/storage, and read-only RPC evidence only. No Metro or device work. The historical duplicate-input cause is a medium-confidence node/API-view inference, not a reproduced node defect. Orchestrator owns iOS/Android QA; TX-1 runtime boxes stay open. |
| 2026-10-17 | A-18 / I-19 private explorer | `claude/fix-sepolia-provider-explorer` from `a1e758fd`: `testnetEnvironment.js` (`explorerUrl`, null in the private environment), `CoinData.js` and `coin-helpers.js` (VRSCTEST explorer getters) | The private chain has no public explorer; existing explorer guards hide or disable the action when the URL is null. The `no runners?!` warning (A-14 / I-15) comes from rejected Infura/Etherscan keys in the local `env` (Infura HTTP 401, Etherscan invalid key), not from the Sepolia code. A proposed PublicNode read fallback was removed: a new third-party endpoint needs an owner decision. | Owner: provide valid keys or decide on a fallback endpoint.

| 2026-10-17 | A-16/I-20 VRPC history correctness; I-21 investigation | `claude/fix-history-conversions` from `a1e758fd`; VRPC updates, transaction standardization, Overview, and transaction detail Type | Design contract: retain the existing history row and detail slots, controls, and styles; correct conversion text and destination data only. Read-only private Testnet RPC supplies four requested transactions and the combined import. One-off Node checks execute source parsing and press/detail callbacks: 11 regression cases fail on the baseline; all 16 cases pass after the fix. The combined arrival is two outputs in one import transaction, so its aggregation remains. Babel parse (four files), `check:design` (30 canonical sources), and diff whitespace checks pass. | I-21 is unresolved: the C6 press callback and detail data pass on both versions. Stable VRPC keys and immutable sorting remove list identity/state defects but do not prove a native tap fix. Orchestrator owns pending/confirmed, light/dark, normal/compact native QA.

| 2026-10-17 | I-16: exclude mempool-spent funding inputs | `claude/fix-mempool-spent-utxos` from `a1e758fd`; VRPC UTXO/mempool helpers, cache bypass, preflight, claim and gift-card identity fee funding | Read-only private-chain queries confirm UTXO fields; both mempools were empty. Installed RPC client types and daemon source confirm spending outpoint fields. The fixture failed before the fix and passes after it: 14 eligible real outputs become 13 with one synthetic spend; empty mempool retains all 20 raw outputs. Cache, failure, and preflight-message fixtures pass. Babel parsing and design check pass. | No broadcasts, Metro, or devices. Orchestrator owns consecutive-send and confirmation/retry QA. Discovery observations remain intact. Missing spending outpoints fail closed. TX-1.8/1.9 stay open. |
| 2026-10-17 | A-19: successful Send/Convert cannot return to live Confirm | `claude/fix-send-success-back` from `f22b7ab9`: `SendWizardConfirm.js`, `SendWizardSuccess.js`, `SendWizardNavigator.js`, new `wizardNavigation.js` | React Navigation native 6.0.13 / stack 6.3.4. Shared submit resets the inner stack to Success only. A synchronous latch and the existing context `txResult` block further submit calls and disable the hold button. Success hardware Back consumes the event and runs Done (unchanged: reset to Wallet home). Header Close keeps the shared exit to the opener. The result back arrow stays absent; the inner swipe stays disabled. Temporary non-Jest checks run the source submit callback with mocked send boundaries and the installed StackRouter: four regression cases fail before the fix; six cases pass after it, including definite-failure retry and ambiguous-broadcast blocking. Babel parse (four source files), `check:design` (30 canonical sources), `check:safe-areas --changed`, and `git diff --check` pass. | Source and synthetic navigation evidence only. No Metro, device, emulator, or simulator work. Orchestrator owns native Back/swipe, new-send, conversion, and cross-chain QA. Broader TX-1 remains open. |
| 2026-10-17 | TX-1 correctness: A-15/A-20 conversion estimates | `claude/fix-conversion-estimates` from `f22b7ab9`: `estimateConversion.js`, `SendWizardAmount.js`, `SelectionSheets.js` | Shared RPC helper sends a JSON number, rejects nonfinite or lossy decimal conversion, omits absent `via`/`preconvert`, and retains `preconvert: false`. Amount estimates and best-route choice use only daemon outputs. Failed routes retain selection with the existing error wording; existing skeleton, error, row, theme, and layout styles remain. One-off non-Jest React/RPC fixtures reproduce the old vETH fallback (8.550589563), then check daemon output, partial/all failures, failed-route selection, amount-change cancellation, and 8-decimal serialization. Read-only curl through the installed client serializer: four required routes succeed with names and `preconvert: false`, names with `preconvert` omitted, and currency IDs with `preconvert: false`. Outputs: 0.99973259 USD, 0.99974158 VRSC-USD, 0.00000596 vETH, 0.99926542 VRSCTEST. String control returns -32601. Full responses: untracked `conversion-estimates-qa.local.md`. Babel parse (3 files), design (30 canonical sources), safe-area (2 files), Send wizard option matrix, and diff whitespace checks pass. Review/preflight calculations are unchanged. | Orchestrator owns device QA: success, loading, unavailable estimate, failed-route selection, amount edit/retry, and Back, in light/dark and normal/compact layouts.

The option matrix reproduced both defects before their fixes, then passed with private/mainnet vETH definitions, renamed Ethereum systems, non-Ethereum systems, and MKR network labels. Live private/mainnet `getcurrency vETH` both report proof protocol 3 and native destination type 9 (`DEST_ETH`). Executed source callbacks accept a valid Ethereum recipient, reject Verus destinations, select ETH/ERC20 self addresses, and build `DEST_ETH`. Existing intent context and validator accept the private-chain zero-amount fee quote and 0.05 unsigned candidate from `sendcurrency` with `returntx=true`: zero inputs, one output, Ethereum recipient. Babel parse and `check:design` pass. | Parent QA owns native recipient, sheet, Back/retry, and success-state checks. No devices, Metro, signing, broadcast, mainnet build, merge, or push in this task. |
| 2026-10-15 | SV-1 second buttons use `secondary` | `claude/sv1-secondary-buttons` from `redesign` (`dbd78021`): `AcknowledgeSheet.js` (the `dismissLabel` button is `variant="secondary"`, 10 points below the primary), `GiftCardServiceOverview.js` (the funding footer's "Fund from another wallet" is `variant="secondary"`, stack gap 10), `DESIGN.md` (a core rule for second buttons; Confirmation; Gift card detail Actions) | The user saw that SV-1 drew "Not now" and "Fund from another wallet" as text buttons, while the app uses the filled `secondary` button for a second action (41 uses, for example `AddressBookEditSheet` "Cancel" with gap 10 and GenericRequest "Leave without sending"; `text` has 12, mostly third-level links such as "Other options"). The SV-1 mockup and DESIGN.md had set `text`. Real taps, Metro from the worktree: `Verus GR3 QA` (`GR3 Test 2`, Testnet, Face ID) and `Verus GR3 Compact` (`SE QA`, Testnet, disposable password).

| 2026-10-15 | SV-1.15 and SV-1.16: Android txid row and hardware Back on the gift card detail | `claude/sv1-android-back-txid` from `redesign` (`a02f1c10`): `GiftCardServiceOverview.js` only. SV-1.15: the pending txid `Text` drops `selectable` (Android does not ellipsize selectable text; `CopyAction` copies the full ID). SV-1.16: a `useFocusEffect` adds a `BackHandler` listener only while the detail shows and the screen has focus; it calls `setSelectedCardId(null)`, as the arrow does, and returns `true`. | Metro from this worktree; installed debug build `com.verusmobile`; real taps through adb, Testnet, VRSCTEST, disposable password. `Small_360x640` (`AND Small`): hardware Back on the detail → list; Back on the list → Services; detail → QR code → Back → detail → Back → list; a fast double Back from QR → list (before the fix the second Back left the screen, which likely explains the one-off Services-root result); the edge back gesture (gesture navigation) on the detail → list and on the list → Services; Back with the ⋯ sheet open closes only the sheet; the on-screen arrows still work. Card "SV1 txid fix" funded 0.01 (`be520138…`): Pending row shows one monospace line with a middle ellipsis, 17 dp high (light). `Pixel_8_API_35` (`SV1QA`): Back and the edge gesture on the detail → list; list Back → Services; card "SV1 txid P8" funded 0.01 (`26f7f18f…`, 2 confirmations on `api.verustest.net`): one line with a middle ellipsis in dark and light, copy shows the check; the share confirmation closes on Back; after Share the QR screen → Back → detail, a fast double Back → list, two edge gestures → detail → list; with the detail open, Back on the Wallet tab sends the app to the launcher, as it does without the detail. iOS `Verus GR3 QA` (`GR3 Test 2`, Face ID): card "SV1 txid iOS" funded 0.01 (`d4484267…`); the Pending row is still one line with a middle ellipsis (dark). Checks: `check:design` (30 sources), `check:safe-areas` (1 file), Babel parse, `git diff --check`. Evidence: `docs/qa/sv1-android-fixes/` in the worktree `.claude/worktrees/eager-napier-b85de5` (ignored; no QR code). | SV-1.17 was decided in a separate change (keep the behavior). Not changed: on 360×640 the QR screen content is taller than the viewport, so the scroll view clips the QR frame at the top of "Save to photos"; after a scroll the frame and the warning show above the button. The button covers nothing; a fix needs a design choice (a smaller QR on compact heights or a scroll cue). Not run: the txid row in dark on the small AVD and in light on iOS; clipboard content (the copy check was seen). Test cards left: `AND Small` holds "SV1 txid fix" (Ready, not shared), `SV1QA` holds "SV1 txid P8" (Shared, 0.01 still on it), and `GR3 Test 2` holds "SV1 txid iOS" (funded, not shared). |
| 2026-10-15 | SV-1 Android run and a claim by the local VRSCTEST daemon | `redesign` at `3db8f25b` (no source change), Metro from the worktree `claude/sv1-android-qa`, installed debug build `com.verusmobile` | Real taps on the Pixel_8_API_35 emulator (profile `SV1QA`, imported from the designated disposable seed with Testnet selected) and the `Small_360x640` AVD (360×640 dp, profile `AND Small`), Testnet, VRSCTEST, disposable password, Custom RPC `https://api.verustest.net`. Services: tiles 179×140 dp (Pixel 8) and 154×140 dp (small), 20 dp inset, 12 dp gaps, equal columns, captions "Send funds or IDs", "Save addresses", "1 card", "2 cards"; light and dark; both tiles open. Gift card "SV1 Android QA": Not funded (footer, no tiles, ⋯ rows) → Share before funding sheet → funded 0.01 in the app (`96b35453…`) → Pending → Ready (76 dp tiles) → the confirmation closes on Not now, hardware Back and an outside tap → Share → Android sheet → Copy → Shared; a second share skips the sheet. NFC tile on the emulator: "NFC is not supported on this device." Claim by the daemon: the card QR was decoded on the Mac (Vision); the key derived from it gives the funded address (matches the funding output and `getaddressutxos`); the daemon signed a sweep with the key on stdin: `8de181f2…`, 0.0099 to daemon address `RBAn5W…nfTBZC` (`ismine` true). While unconfirmed the card stayed Shared with 0.01; at 1 confirmation it showed Claimed, "Empty", Claimed by `RBAn5W…nfTBZC` (copy gives the full address) and Claimed; the list shows the Claimed badge and filter. External funding: card "SV1 Android ext" funded by daemon `sendtoaddress` 0.02 (`1c86ee5b…`) stayed "Not funded" until confirmed, then went straight to Ready; daemon claim `86201936…` → Claimed by `RVx5aS…DYEfoT`. Small AVD: Not funded, Pending, Ready, Shared, ⋯ sheet, confirmation with Not now, light and dark (`a1d1945f…` funds "SV1 Small QA", left Shared). Filter row: a tap on the left part of "All" after scrolling selects it. `font_scale` 1.3 changes nothing in the app. All transactions checked on the daemon. Evidence: `docs/qa/sv1-android/` (ignored; no QR images). | Open: SV-1.15 (txid row clipped on Android), SV-1.16 (hardware Back from the detail leaves the list), SV-1.17 (Android share sheet always counts as Shared; decision). Seen, not changed: on 360×640 the last fact row sits under the bottom scroll fade at rest (readable after a scroll); the QR screen's "Save to photos" button overlaps the bottom of the QR frame (the code stays whole). Not run: NFC write, a share target other than Copy, password-protected cards, non-native contents, Cancel and Remove, the QR screen in dark. |
| 2026-10-15 | Gift card fixes from SV-1 Track B QA | `claude/gift-card-fund-comma-and-fade-taps` from `redesign` (`1a439685`): `GiftCardFund.js` (amount `onChangeText` runs `sanitizeNumericInput`, the helper Receive already uses, so a comma becomes a dot before validation and before the outputs are built), `ScrollEdgeFade.js` (the `Svg` now sits in a `View` that has `pointerEvents="none"`, the position and the size) | Real taps on `Verus GR3 QA` (`GR3 Test 2`, Testnet, Face ID), Metro from this worktree. Comma: before the fix "0,01" stayed as typed and "Review gift card" stayed disabled; after it the field shows "0.01", the button is enabled and the review step lists VRSCTEST 0.01 (not funded; no transaction sent). Filter row: before the fix a tap at x=24 and x=28 on "All" did nothing ("Ready" stayed selected), also with no scroll, so the invisible left fade (opacity 0) catches the touch; x=60 worked. After the fix a tap at x=24 selects "All", the row still scrolls, the left fade still shows, and a tap on "Pending" under the fade (x=26) selects it. Checks: `check:design` (30 sources), `check:safe-areas` (2 files), Babel parse. | Not run: Android; a vertical `FadedScrollView` with overflow after the change (only the gift card list, which did not overflow, and the fund step were seen); a real comma-locale keyboard (the simulator keypad showed a comma key and the typed comma reached the field). The root cause for the swallowed touch is inferred from the before/after taps, not from a view-hierarchy dump. |
| 2026-10-15 | SV-1 Track B: fixed gift card screen (SV-1.6–1.14) | `claude/sv1-gift-card-detail-7ab6e6` from `redesign` (`87566047`): `GiftCardServiceOverview.js`, new `GiftCardFixedCard.js`, new `src/components/StatusBadge.js` and `statusBadge.styles.js` (exported from `src/styles/index.js`), `GiftCardQrScreen.js`, `giftCardPresentation.js` and its unit test, `giftCard.js` (one message), `DESIGN.md`; `GiftCardFlipCard.js` deleted | Spec change (SV-1.6): the presentation unit test now expects "Claimed", "Shared", "No contents yet" and "Empty" instead of "Redeemed", "Ready to fund" and "Claim completed"; internal `redeemed` names kept. Pending amounts come only from the outputs that `addGiftCardPendingFunding` stores from the pending broadcast; a record without outputs shows its VerusIDs or "No contents yet". Real taps on `Verus GR3 QA` (`GR3 Test 2`, Testnet, Face ID) and `Verus GR3 Compact` (`SE QA`, Testnet, disposable password), Metro from this worktree. Card "SV1 detail QA": Not funded (light) → ⋯ with "Share before funding" → confirmation with the empty-card text; Not now, outside tap and Share each checked (Share opened the system sheet; dismissing it rolled the attempt back, card stayed Not funded) → funded 0.01 VRSCTEST (`96ae4b21…`) → Pending with the dimmed recorded amount, the funding transaction row and copy (light, dark) → Ready (dark) → QR code → funded-card confirmation → Share → Shared (dark) → ⋯ Cancel gift card → existing cancel sheet → claim `918e3b70…` → Claimed with Claimed by (copy verified on the clipboard), Claimed and Created (light, dark). SE card with a long name: Not funded with footer, Fund from another wallet opens the external step, funded 0.01, Ready, confirmation, QR, Shared (light, dark). List: neutral Shared and Claimed badges, summaries without "Shared ·", Shared and Claimed filters (dark). A shared card skips the sheet. Fixed during QA: the QR screen showed "Gift card unavailable" on a first share (it read storage before the share was saved; it now waits while the share is reserved); the funding footer vanished during a share attempt; the card shadow was clipped at the top. Independent review (SV-1.14, report only): nothing blocking; fixed visible "Redeemed" wording, a hidden pending addition on a funded card, plural wording and dead code. Checks: `check:design` (30 sources), `check:safe-areas` (8 files), Babel parse, `git diff --check`, `giftCardPresentation` and `giftCard` unit suites (53 tests), an ESLint undefined/unused pass. Evidence: `docs/qa/sv1-track-b/` (ignored). | Not run: NFC write (no NFC on the simulator), Android, large text size, the native Share sheet completing a real send, Claimed reached through a second profile (this run cancelled the card back to its own wallet). Seen, not changed: the fund amount field rejects a comma decimal from the iOS keypad ("0,01"); the left fade of the filter row swallows taps on the left part of "All" after scrolling. Decisions: a Not funded card shows no share tiles ("Share before funding" in ⋯ uses the system share after the sheet); the card-variant neutral badge uses the mockup's light tint; a shared card that is still empty keeps the funding footer. |
| 2026-10-15 | SV-1 Track A: Services tiles (SV-1.1–1.5) | `claude/sv1-services-tiles-1b8f39` from `redesign` (`87566047`): `SignedInServicesHome.js`, `signedIn.js` (purpose lines replace the two descriptions); deleted `services-gift-card-folded.png` and `services-address-book-folded.png` (nothing else imported them) | iOS simulators `Verus GR3 QA` (402 pt) and `Verus GR3 Compact` (iPhone SE), Metro from the worktree, real taps, Testnet. The tile is local to the Services root, so its styles stay in the screen. The gift card count reads `requestServiceStoredData(GIFT_CARD_SERVICE_ID)` through `normalizeGiftCardServiceData`, as `GiftCardService` does; both counts load on focus. `GR3 Test 2`: dark and light, "3 cards" (the list holds 3 cards); the address line went "Save addresses" → "1 saved" → "2 saved" → "1 saved" → "Save addresses" as test records were added and removed, each on return to the tab. SE: a new disposable Testnet profile `SV1 Tiles QA`, dark and light with no cards and no addresses ("Send funds or IDs", "Save addresses"), then "1 card" after one unfunded card was saved through "Fund from another wallet". Measured tiles: 175×140 (402 pt) and 161×140 (SE); the mockup gives 170.5×140 at 393 pt. Both tiles open their screens. At the largest accessibility text size nothing changes, because `applyGlobalTypography.js` turns off font scaling. Checks: `check:design` (30 sources), `check:safe-areas` on `SignedInServicesHome.js`, a Babel parse (2 files), `git diff --check`. ESLint does not start in this checkout (`eslint-plugin-import` cannot load; environment). Evidence: `docs/qa/sv1-track-a/` (ignored). | Icons use the Lucide default stroke (2), as the sheet action rows do; the mockup draws 1.8. The user kept 2 (2026-10-15). Not run: Android, VoiceOver (labels from source, for example "Gift cards. 3 cards"), the loading state (the line stays empty until the first load ends; too fast to capture), and the load-error path (falls back to the purpose line; source only). The SE keeps `SV1 Tiles QA` with one unfunded card. |
| 2026-10-15 | SV-1 preparation | `claude/sv1-prep` from `redesign` (`c817c795`): `DESIGN.md`, `AcknowledgeSheet.js`, this plan | The user chose the Services tiles and the fixed gift card from HTML mockups (artifact and `docs/qa/sv1/mockup.html`), then corrected the copy button, the sheet action rows, the status dot, and the missing "Not now". DESIGN.md now has the status badge rule, the Confirmation sheet rule, the "Services home" and "Gift card detail" patterns, and four pattern-map rows. `AcknowledgeSheet` takes an optional `dismissLabel` that renders an `AppButton` with `variant="text"`; without it the sheet is unchanged. Checks: `check:design` (30 sources), `check:safe-areas` on `AcknowledgeSheet.js`, a Babel parse, `git diff --check`. | The dismiss button is not rendered yet; Track B renders it on the simulator (SV-1.13). Next: Track A (SV-1.1–1.5) and Track B (SV-1.6–1.14) in parallel. If both merges touch this log, keep both rows. |
| 2026-10-12 | O7 completion feedback | `claude/request-completion-feedback` from `redesign` (`9ea5133d`), merged into `redesign`: `NeutralCheckMark.js` (new), `GenericRequestHome.js`, `DESIGN.md`, one mock line in `genericResponseNetwork.unit.test.js` (the test mocks each component that `GenericRequestHome` imports) | iPhone SE, Metro, real taps, deeplink-sim, screen video frames. The first-pass O7 finding was wrong: a POST sign in shows “Preparing response”, “Sending response” and “Response sent” (the check animates, then holds about a second) before it returns to the wallet. The first-pass screenshots caught only the wallet. Changed: the “Request complete” (no response sent) and “Browser opened” sheets use a neutral mark instead of the green check, because they confirm no delivery. Verified in dark and light mode; the POST sheet keeps the green check. `check:design`, `check:safe-areas`, parse, and the three nearby unit suites pass. The full jest run has 25 failing suites; the ones I read fail on the `react-native-svg` and native-module setup, and the `lucide-react-native` import in `HighRiskStep.js` predates my work. | Not changed: a POST success closes by itself after 0.9 s while the other two wait for Done; the identity-update sheet is a near copy of this sheet; app encryption, data and credential flows share this code path but were not re-recorded; Android not re-run. |
| 2026-10-12 | Small-device follow-up: compact titles, gift-card acknowledgement sheet, unlock and payment fixes | `claude/small-device-followup` from `redesign` (`7148dfc3`), merged into `redesign`: `RequestTitle.js` and `AcknowledgeSheet.js` (new), `BottomSheetModal.js`, `UnlockWalletSheet.js`, `SendModal.render.js`, `GenericRequestHome.js`, `GiftCardServiceIntroSlider.js`, nine request screens and five style files | `Verus GR3 Compact` (iPhone SE), the `Small_360x640` AVD (720×1280 px), Metro, real taps, VRSCTEST daemon, deeplink-sim. Verified: compact titles (26/32) on both devices; sign in, app encryption, identity-update review and high-risk titles fit on one line; gift-card acknowledgement sheet on both; the sync-failed alert shows over the unlock sheet on Android and “No” finishes the unlock; the unlock sheet with the keyboard fits on Android and SE; the payment review no longer adds the status bar inset twice on Android; a failed delivery shows the host on its own line. Checks: `check:design`, `check:safe-areas --changed`, parse, three existing unit suites (8 tests). | Not changed: O5 and O6 are dev-only (the LogBox warning comes from `react-native-tab-view` 3.5.2 under React 18.3; the “Refreshing…” banner is the Fast Refresh indicator); O7 completion feedback needs a design decision; the O8 chevron did not reproduce (the chip is not pressable on data reviews); long VerusID names still truncate. Not run: dark mode on SE, Android payment send, text scaling. |
| 2026-10-12 | Small-device GenericRequest run (iPhone SE and 360×640 dp Android) | `claude/small-device-gr-qa` from `redesign` (`565da5d5`), merged into `redesign`: `BottomSheetModal.js`, `PasswordCheck.js`, `ProvisionIdentityBottomSheet.js`, `AuthenticationRequestInfo.js`, `AppEncryptionRequestInfo.js`, `InvoiceInfo.js`, `InvoicePaymentReview.js`, `InvoicePaymentResult.js`, `SpendableKeyRequestInfo.js` | `Verus GR3 Compact` (iPhone SE, iOS 26.5), a Pixel 8 AVD at 720×1280 px (size override) and a real 720×1280 AVD, Metro, real taps, VRSCTEST daemon, deeplink-sim and the provisioning webhook. Harness-verified: sign in, + app encryption, data packet, + data packet, credential variants, identity update (content add, tx confirmed), invoice (paid 0.01), five delivery modes, six rejections. High-risk updates, claim with no funds, wallet backup and provisioning reviewed only. Fixed: Android tall sheets ran off the screen (identity-update acknowledgement button unreachable; `BottomSheetModal` max height), provisioning and password sheets hid Continue behind the keyboard, five reviews had no scroll cue, a claim ended with a false “No response was sent” sheet. Design, safe-area, parse and completion-flow checks pass. | Open: unlock hangs when the sync-failed alert opens under the unlock sheet (Android), identity-update review and payment review clipping (Android), dev warning toast over Send, “Refreshing…” banner over the title, inconsistent completion feedback. Not run: NFC, funded claim, gift-card creation, registration, Android payments. Local report: `docs/qa/small-device/report.local.md` and `gallery.local.html` (ignored). |
| 2026-10-11 | NFC-1 tap screen (NFC-1.9–1.11) | `codex/nfc-1-claim-from-card`, same commit as NFC-1.1–1.7: `walletBackupNfc.js` (phase runner, error codes, iOS sheet text, session flag), new `nfcTapText.js`, new `components/NfcTap/` (`NfcTapSymbol`, `NfcTapView`, `NfcTapModal`, `NfcTapHost`), new `nfcTap.styles.js`, new `useReduceMotion.js`, `nfcTap` reducer and dispatchers, `VerusMobile.js` (host, security cover), `deeplinkNfc.js`, `WalletBackupRequestInfo.js` and its styles, `ImportNfc.js`, `GiftCardShareController.js`, `GiftCardShareSheet.js`, `GiftCardServiceOverview.js`, `tokens.js` (`primaryBackground`); `deeplinkNfcSubmission.unit.test.js` ported to the tap screen | iOS simulators `Verus GR3 QA` (402 pt) and `Verus GR3 Compact` (iPhone SE), Metro, real taps. NFC came from a fake chip patched into the running debug app through the debugger (`NfcManager` methods replaced in memory; no app code; gone after the app stopped). The fake recorded the iOS sheet calls. Claim read signed out: waiting (“Hold the card here”, waves up), active (“Hold still”, ring), done (check) → “Claim this card” opened by itself; sheet “Hold still.” → “Done.”. Card moved → “Card moved too soon” with Try again and Cancel; sheet error “Card moved too soon.”; Try again → waiting. Wallet-backup card signed out → “Wallet backup found” with Restore wallet; from Login → Other options it closed and opened the restore step, which started its own read. Signed in → “Wallet backup found” with Close only. Restore: no backup (notice), no card (failed), sheet Cancel (back to start, no text), a fresh unencrypted throwaway backup → “Backup found” → “Personalize your wallet” (stopped there; no wallet created). Backup from Settings (GR3 Test 2, encrypted): preparing with grey ring during the multi-minute encryption (JS thread busy, ring kept turning), waiting, active, “Backup written” with the wallet-password text, Done → Security & recovery. Unencrypted: card moved → failed → Try again → written with the no-password text. Request mode (dark, from “Back up first”): failed → Try again went straight to the read after the fix (first run asked the no-password question again) → “Backup written” with Continue → GR3-D17 screen, cancelled. Gift card write (new unfunded draft “NFC2 tap test”): waiting, card moved → failed, Try again → “Gift card written” with Done → card shows “Shared from this wallet”. Light and dark at 402 pt; compact dark (no card found, notice with two actions). Normal-size “Get started” has three rows on the simulator: the NFC support check runs before the fake loads. Fixed during QA: repeated no-password question on Try again; a program error (TypeError) showed its raw text, now the general hint; known card results no longer log as errors. Checks: Babel parse (32 files), `check:design`, `check:safe-areas --changed` (22 files), `git diff --check`; Jest: NFC read (4, ported) and NFC module (33) pass. `nfcImportSubmission` and `walletBackupRequestSession` fail to load before and after (incomplete `react-native` mock). Evidence: `docs/qa/nfc2/` (ignored). | NFC-1.8 on the physical iPhone: real card, real iOS sheet, haptics, timing, security cover. Android not run (5-second hold, centered layout, Cancel button, translucent status bar). NFC-D1–D4 recorded. |
| 2026-10-11 | NFC-1 claim from an NFC card (NFC-1.1–1.7) | `codex/nfc-1-claim-from-card` from `redesign` (`74706a68`), uncommitted: `deeplinkNfc.js`, `walletBackupNfc.js`, new `useNfcSupported.js`, `LoadingModal.js`, `OnboardingStartSheet.js`, `LandingScreen.js`, `OtherOptionsSheet.js`, `Login.js`, `VerusPay.js`, `CreateProfile.js`; test mock in `deeplinkNfcSubmission.unit.test.js` | iOS simulators (`Verus GR3 QA`, `Verus GR3 Compact` iPhone SE), Metro, real taps. The simulator has no NFC, so a temporary, uncommitted stub made `isNfcSupported` true and returned a chosen card result; the stub is removed and no QA code remains. Card link: an unsigned VRSCTEST wallet-backup + spendable-key request with a new throwaway key (address derived with the app's own key code), funded 0.01 (`5b8090f3…`). Signed out with wallets: Other options → “Claim from NFC card” → status modal → “Claim this card” (first time this choice is reachable) → Claim to existing wallet → 0.0099 found after one confirmation → unlock GR3 Test 2 → claim `d6a1b0a8…` (mempool, spends the funding) → balance 5.0289 → 5.0388. Signed in: Scan → button → “Claim this card”; reopening the claimed card showed GR3-D17. No wallets (compact): “Get started” has four rows; Import and Back keep them; the read opens “Create wallet” for the card. Onboarding Scan QR code with the card link (scanner `onScan` called through the debugger; no simulator camera) opens the same request; Cancel returns to Welcome. Messages: wallet-backup card signed in (explanation) and signed out (Continue opens the NFC restore step); “Nothing to claim”; “Card not read”; cancel shows nothing. Light and dark: Other options, status modal, claim choice, Scan button, Get started (compact). The stuck-modal race was reproduced at 0 ms and gone after the fix. A JS reload while signed in closed the debug app once (fits GR3-E2; no crash report). Checks: Babel parse (11 files), `check:design`, `check:safe-areas --changed`, `git diff --check`; Jest: NFC read and NFC backup suites, 37 tests pass. `profileCreationSubmission` and `walletBackupRequestSession` fail to load before and after (no VisionCamera mock; missing `StyleSheet` mock). Evidence: `docs/qa/nfc1/` (ignored). | NFC-1.8 on the physical iPhone with a card (GR-3.9 session): real NFC reads from all three entries, the Scan button over the live camera, the iOS NFC sheet and cancel. Normal-size “Get started” not captured (the normal simulator has wallets). Android not run. GR3-D16 and GR3-D17 recorded for later. |
| 2026-10-10 | GR-3.17 GR-1/GR-2 closure and QA-1 record | `codex/gr3-request-matrix` at `dd3a476f`; local `docs/genericrequest-types-and-chains.html` (ignored) | Runtime gap checks first (iOS `Verus GR3 QA`, profile `GR3 Test 2`; Android emulator, profile `GR3 Android`): credential request with a required signer the wallet does not control showed “Required VerusID unavailable” with Switch wallet and sent nothing; with its own ID it proceeded; the request-details sheet showed the full required ID and closed and reopened; a data-packet request opened while locked showed “Unlock wallet to review”, unlocked with Face ID from the request, kept every item unchecked with “Sign data” disabled, and after consent the harness verified 4 signatures; the iOS picker opened and showed the selected state after the GR3-B9 fix; Android hardware Back on a review returned to Wallet and sent nothing (GR3-D15: request state not cleared). QA-1 for GR-1/GR-2/GR-3: QA-1.1 contracts, commits, and touched paths are in the GR rows above. QA-1.2 light and dark at normal size on the real app; compact from the GR-1 fixtures and GR-3.13; GR-3 compact deferred by the user. QA-1.3 labels and enabled states from the Android accessibility tree (every control labelled, “Sign data” disabled until consent; each checkbox row also exposes an inner unlabelled disabled node, possible duplicate announcement, not confirmed); sheet close/reopen; Android hardware Back; safe areas and scroll cues in screenshots; text scaling has no effect app-wide; reduced motion and full VoiceOver/TalkBack not run. QA-1.4 design, safe-area, parser, and focused Jest checks pass for every GR-3 commit. QA-1.5 GR-1/GR-2 independent design and signing reviews READY (GR-1/GR-2 report); GR-3 changes have no separate independent review. QA-1.6 shared changes rechecked on sign-in, identity update, invoice, and claim in GR-3.16. QA-1.7 screens, callbacks, and transactions recorded separately. QA-1.8 open items have owners: GR3-B8 task, GR-3.9 user device, GR3-B4 and P1 deferred, GR3-D12 and D15 recorded. Protocol map refreshed: nine supported details, unsigned order rules, delivery path, error state, runtime evidence per type, open items; renders at desktop and 375 px width without page overflow, light and dark tokens. | Full VoiceOver/TalkBack walkthrough, reduced motion, and the text-scaling decision stay as QA-1 follow-ups. GR-3 has no separate independent review. GR-3.12, GR-3.13, and GR-3.16 wait for GR-3.9. |
| 2026-10-10 | GR-3.16 matrix rerun and Android smoke | `codex/gr3-request-matrix` at `8270ae32`, fixes in commit `dd3a476f`: `SpendableKeyRequestInfo.js` (claiming spinner) and `IdentityPickerSheet.js` (boolean `accessibilityState`) | iOS `Verus GR3 QA`, profile `GR3 Test 2`, cold launch, real taps. Harness-verified: sign-in + app encryption in POST, fail once (attempt 2), fail always (Leave without sending), redirect (Safari verified, Browser opened sheet), no callback (Request complete); identity update content add `12eecb53…` and content replace with fail once `d33d60ce…` (one transaction, same txid redelivered), both confirmed; high-risk authorities cancelled with no callback; data packet POST and fail always; credential missing; both credential/data-packet orders; sign-in + credentials and sign-in + invoice (`4c74bb97…`) with the GR-3.19 labels; invoice only `2f6e9187…`; six rejected-request cases with no callbacks; provisioning accepted by the webhook, then the expected failure notice (GR3-E1). Claiming state held with a QA-only debugger hold (removed): before/after in light and dark, claim `cfdafdc8…`. Android `Pixel_8_API_35`, debug APK, new disposable profile `GR3 Android`: app encryption POST, sign-in + data packet (“Continue to sign data”), identity update `b2b03cdb…`, credential missing, wrong network and over-length, provisioning accepted, invoice `eeede94a…`, gift-card claim `3e55575c…` with the fixed claiming state in light and dark. GR3-B9 reproduced on Android before the fix and gone after it. GR3-B8 reproduced three times on iOS; a debugger counter showed an identical signed transaction returned as success. Checks: Babel parse, `check:design`, `check:safe-areas --changed`, `git diff --check`; Jest: identity picker and spendable key suites, 38 tests pass. | GR3-B8 triage (outside the redesign). Credential matching and provisioning registration need GR3-E1 cleared. Wallet backup on the physical iPhone (GR-3.9). Compact deferred. Android: GR3-D12 also hits the unlock sheet after a sync failure. |
| 2026-10-10 | GR-3.19 mixed-request next step | `codex/gr3-request-matrix`, commit `8270ae32`: new `genericRequestNextStep.js`; `GenericRequestHome.js`, `AuthenticationRequestInfo.js` | iPhone 17 Pro simulator, VRSCTEST, profile `GR3 Test 2`, real taps. Before: auth + data packet showed “Sign in with VerusID”, then “Sign data” with no hint. After: the same request showed “Continue to sign data” once a VerusID was selected; it opened “Sign data”; signing all four items delivered one response (harness: authentication verified, 4 signatures, 1 attempt) and the app returned to Wallet. Auth + credential: “Continue to share credentials” (about 231 of about 295 points available on iPhone SE, so no truncation) opened “Share credentials” (light and dark); cancelled. Auth + provisioning (local webhook): the label stays “Sign in with VerusID”; cancelled, nothing submitted. Cancel at step 2 sent nothing (harness `waiting`, 0 attempts). A node script on the real helper with real VDXF keys covers 15 mixes (each type, provisioning, skipped backup, auth last, already processed). Checks: Babel parse, `check:design`, `check:safe-areas --changed`, `git diff --check`; Jest: completion and link-failure suites, 11 tests pass. | Invoice, Identity Update, wallet backup and claim labels verified by script only. Compact size not run. |
| 2026-10-10 | GR-3.18 high-risk steps, names, claim review | `codex/gr3-request-matrix`, commit `50727421`: `HighRiskStep.js` + `highRiskStep.styles.js`, `VerusIdContentChangeCard.js` + `verusIdObjectData.styles.js`, `IdentityUpdateRequestInfo.js`, `ProvisionIdentityBottomSheet.js`, `fullyqualifiedname.js`, `SpendableKeyRequestInfo.js` + `spendableKeyRequestInfo.styles.js`, `spendableKey.js` | iPhone 17 Pro simulator, VRSCTEST, new disposable profile `GR3 Test 2` (Face ID), real taps, light and dark. Before/after with deeplink-sim high-risk requests on `liveqa09482856.antafri@` (all cancelled, nothing approved): authorities step shows current and new recovery and revocation IDs in full (was `TestBob....SCTEST@` only); shared-control step shows the added address `RSRGXw62…` (was “Added”); acknowledgement sheet shows names with i-addresses; clear-content cards read “Unnamed key” with the full i-address (was `iDdo...GC45`); “Updating identity” wraps after a dot. Provisioning (local webhook, not submitted; request stayed `qr_generated`): the name preview and the review row wrap after a dot. Gift-card claim: card funded from the daemon with 0.05 VRSCTEST (txid `d7e1b9ca1a0c0b6830c43e65f079cb90bed75dc872cb3499cf34db90585e3562`); the review showed To `GR3 Test 2` / `RXW9b6Pg…` and Network fee 0.0001 VRSCTEST; claim txid `4dacbc0b869dea3b2b2f81bdcb66d76569a25196b87e8f1ca44992c2b8cedb35` pays 0.0499 to `RXW9b6Pg…` with a 0.0001 fee (daemon). Checks: Babel parse, `check:design`, `check:safe-areas --changed`, `git diff --check`; Jest: 6 related suites, 59 tests pass. | Compact size not run. Loss-of-control and multi-address primary changes use the same rows but were not rendered. The identity picker and the “Request from” card still cut long names with an ellipsis (shared components, out of scope). |
| 2026-10-10 | GR-3.15 request error state | `codex/gr3-request-matrix`, commit `39dabf36`: new `genericRequestRejection.js`; `GenericRequestLoading.js`, `DeepLink.js`, `GenericRequestHome.js`, `sagas/deeplink.js`, `AppThemeProvider.js`; error codes in `requestAccounts.js`, `experimentalDeeplinks.js`, `envelopeValidator.js`, `identityUpdateRequestDetailsHandler.js`, `verusPayInvoiceDetailsValidator.js` | iPhone 17 Pro simulator, VRSCTEST, real taps, light and dark. Signed in: wrong-network-flag “Wrong network”, wrong-network-system “Request not valid”, expired-auth “Request expired”, bad-signature “Cannot verify signer”, unknown-detail “Unsupported request”; Close returned to Wallet each time. Signed out: wrong-network-flag “Request not valid”, Close returned to the signed-out home. Over-length: translated alert, and the backdrop now dims the Wallet (light) and the signed-out home (dark). Network failure injected through the Hermes debugger (QA-only switch on the RPC client, removed, app relaunched): signer lookup failure shows “Network unavailable” with Try again; Try again with the failure still on made one new lookup and showed the error again; with the failure off it opened the sign-in review. Identity Update content lookup failure (content-add request, signed out) showed the error from `GenericRequestHome`; Try again opened “Review VerusID changes”; Close returned to the signed-out home with the deeplink cleared. No request was approved. Checks: Babel parse, `check:design`, `check:safe-areas --changed`, `git diff --check`; Jest: 10 related suites, 55 tests pass; a node script on the real translator covers every mapping. | Experimental-off and delegated-signer copy verified by script only. Compact size not run (deferred). The GR3 Test profile password was lost when the machine crashed (it lived only in `/tmp`), so the signed-in checks after the crash ran signed out. |
| 2026-10-10 | GR-3.14 review leftovers | `codex/gr3-request-matrix`, commit `0c75f191`: `GenericRequestHome.js`, `DeepLinkStackScreens.js`, `InvoicePaymentConfiguration.js`, `ContentStep.js` + `verusIdObjectData.styles.js`, `DataRequestReview.js` + `dataRequestInfo.styles.js`, `math.js`, `genericRequestDelivery.js`, sign-in and app-encryption reviews; network test stubs updated; deeplink-sim `high-risk-private-address` variant on `codex/gr3-generators` (uncommitted) | iPhone 17 Pro simulator, real taps, light and dark. Other-app action and sheet rendered with a temporary, uncommitted “Valu installed” stub (removed): action above the review, review starts under it, footer keeps its bottom inset, sheet in both themes, failed handoff shows “Cannot open Valu Mobile”. Without the stub the review is unchanged. D6: app encryption with HTTP POST shows “POST over HTTP” (review and data details sheet); sign-in with an HTTPS callback shows “Secure POST”; the HTTP request was approved and the harness verified the response (1 attempt). D8: data packet “Statement 1” starts about 42 points under “View request details” (was about 110). D9: identity update “Expires 1 hour”, invoice “About 1 hour”; a node script on the real `blocksToTime` covers 0–100000 blocks, other block times, and invalid input. Content step: private-address change (fresh harness address with no spending key; request cancelled) shows the address once, in monospace. Invoice inline payment options still render. Checks: Babel parse, `check:design`, `check:safe-areas --changed`, Jest: Identity Update (1 test), network (4), and completion (9) suites pass; harness typecheck and 155 tests pass. | Credential review shares the D8 component but was not run. |
| 2026-10-10 | GR-3.13 wallet backup redesign | `codex/gr3-request-matrix` after `ee604685`: `WalletBackupRequestInfo.js`, new `walletBackupRequestInfo.styles.js`, `styles/index.js`, `NfcBackup.js`, `DeepLinkReviewScrollView.js` (keyboard props passed through), `walletBackupNfc.js` (one prompt string) | iPhone 17 Pro and compact simulators, real taps, light and dark. Settings path: options, custom password with keyboard and strength hint, brute-force sheet (Medium to High applied after close), no-password confirmation, and the “Backup not written” alert (simulator has no NFC). Request path from an unsigned VRSCTEST wallet-backup link: signed-out unlock step, create-wallet form, shared unlock sheet (“Wallet backup”, testnet wallet only), options. “Claim this card” choice from the same link with a fresh unfunded spendable key, dispatched with `fromNfc: true` (simulated NFC read). With a temporary, uncommitted NFC write stub (removed; served bundle checked): processing state, “Backup written” with Done (request) or Continue (claim follows), Done finished the request on Wallet with the deeplink cleared (GR-3.12 path), Continue opened the claim step, Settings Done returned to Security & recovery with no alert, and a repeated request skipped the backup (completion marker). Compact: no-wallet create form and keyboard. Fixed during the run: spinner wrapper pushed processing text to the screen edge (`AnimatedActivityIndicatorBox` has `flex: 1`); double status-bar inset under the Settings header; footer partly under the keyboard in Settings; iOS strong-password suggestion left an unseen value in field state (now the onboarding `oneTimeCode` settings). Checks: Babel parse, `check:design`, `check:safe-areas --changed` pass; ESLint cannot load (plugin path error, environment). `walletBackupRequestSession.unit.test.js` already failed to load (mock lacks `StyleSheet`) and pins old copy and the old immediate `next`. A full JS reload while signed in crashed the debug app once (GR3-E2). | Real NFC write, write failure, and card checks on the physical iPhone (GR-3.9). Repair the session test for the result step. `SpendableKeyRequestInfo` uses the same spinner wrapper in its claiming state (likely same defect, not run). |
| 2026-10-10 | GR-3.12 legacy completion removed | `codex/gr3-request-matrix` after `b09f9622`: `genericRequestCompletionFlow.js`, `GenericRequestHome.js`, `DeepLinkStackScreens.js`, `styles/index.js`; deleted `GenericRequestComplete.js` and its styles; updated completion test and checks | iPhone 17 Pro simulator, fresh launch with the new bundle, real taps. Baseline first: auth + invoice already used the delivery sheet after the send modal closed (Response sent, harness received; no refused presentation in the iOS log). After the change: invoice-only payment txid `5bf7884ce618c857a50b14b82c810e8956138ea6d2159049ca5589d07d08ffe6` (mempool), Payment submitted → Done → Wallet with no legacy screen, deeplink cleared. Regression: missing credentials still shows “Request complete / No response was sent”; auth + app encryption POST verified by the harness. Checks: completion Jest suite 9/9 and node check 11 cases pass; parse, `check:design`, `check:safe-areas --changed` pass. `check-generic-request-delivery.js` still fails to load on an existing missing module; its legacy-screen assertions are removed. `genericResponseNetwork.unit.test.js` cannot run (stale `react-native` mock) and still expects the removed route; separate task suggested. | Wallet backup and skipped-backup completion on the physical iPhone (GR-3.9); “backup written” result in GR-3.13. |
| 2026-10-10 | GR-3 Phase 2 functional fixes | `codex/gr3-request-matrix`, uncommitted: `SendModal.render.js`, `AppEncryptionRequestInfo.js` + styles, `AuthenticationRequestInfo.js`, `responseDeliverySecurity.js` | iPhone 17 Pro simulator, VRSCTEST, fresh app launch with the fixed bundle (confirmed in the served bundle), real taps only. GR3-B6: invoice modal now has one `RCTTouchHandler` (lldb) and each touch reaches JS once; Payment details, Done and Send work; payment txid `198d753515400cc59f9bede57fa79ac5232e901941ebcd29bb8488f2e44b5254` (daemon mempool, then balance 4.9684); invoice-only still ends on legacy completion (GR-3.12). Revoke modal (same branch) opened with a throwaway authority: one touch handler, single touch events, back press works; nothing submitted. Recover shares the branch; not run. GR3-B3: auth + app encryption, all five delivery modes, harness-verified: POST (1 verified attempt), fail once (Try again, attempt 2), fail always (Try again fails, Leave without sending returns to Wallet), redirect (Browser opened sheet, Done), no callback (Request complete sheet, no callback). Error sheet also checked in dark mode. The new “Preparing response” button state is too short to capture. GR3-B2: reproduced (stale provisioning request on the next link), then fixed: deeplink ID is null after provisioning and the next link opens its own request. GR3-R1: HTTP response POSTs now need `__DEV__` and the env flag; existing unit tests pass. Checks: Babel parse of changed files, `responseDeliverySecurity` and `genericRequestCompletionFlow` suites pass; `genericRequestDelivery` suite fails to load (store import chain, `constants.js:159`, not touched); `check:design` and `check:safe-areas --changed` pass. New notes: a JS reload crashes the debug app while shielded sync runs (`VerusLightClient` sends on the old bridge; GR3-E2); `react-native-tab-view` 3.5.2 logs a dev “key prop spread” error in the send modal. | Phase 3 (GR-3.12 to GR-3.15, GR-3.18, GR-3.19). Android smoke for B6 in Phase 4. Commit when the user asks. |
| 2026-10-10 | GR-3 Phase 2 triage (root causes) | `codex/gr3-request-matrix`, no new code changes | GR3-B6 reproduced on the iPhone 17 Pro simulator with a fresh invoice: a JS hook logged each touch twice inside the invoice send modal and once on the main screen, and lldb showed two `RCTTouchHandler`s in one view chain (modal root and `RNSScreenView`). Cause: the invoice and identity-safety `Root.Navigator` lacks `detachInactiveScreens={false}`, which upstream `ac501c65` added to the other modal navigators. GR3-B3 cause from source and the Phase 1 log: `AppEncryptionRequestInfo` keeps its loading sheet open while the delivery sheet presents. GR3-B2 and GR3-B4 causes confirmed in source. GR3-D12 is an alert rendered under native modals, not the B3 race. GR3-P1 matches upstream behavior. Fixes not yet applied or run. | User agreement on the bug list and scope (GR-3.11); then the functional fixes, each reproduced first. Revoke/Recover identity likely share B6 (not yet run). |
| 2026-10-09 | GR-3 Phase 1 matrix (iOS normal size) | `codex/gr3-request-matrix`, uncommitted fixes in `ProvisionIdentityBottomSheet.js` and `getIdentityContent.js`; deeplink-sim harness fixes uncommitted on `codex/gr3-generators` | iPhone 17 Pro simulator, VRSCTEST. Harness-verified callbacks: authentication + app encryption (all five delivery modes), data packet, credential (matching, partial; missing correctly sends none), both credential/data-packet orders, authentication + data packet, + credential, + invoice. Confirmed VRSCTEST transactions: three identity updates, two invoice payments, gift card fund and spendable-key claim. All six negative cases rejected with no callback. Dark mode renders correctly. Fixed and verified: GR3-B1 (provisioning sheet session context), GR3-B5 (identity content lookup rejected testnet names). Open: GR3-B2 stale deeplink after provisioning, GR3-B3 delivery sheet not presented under the detail screen's processing sheet (stuck dim screen on failure and no-callback), GR3-B4 long FQN request IDs crash parsing under Hermes, GR3-B6 invoice send modal ignores presses. Protocol question GR3-P1 (authentication response request ID). Details: local `gr3-matrix.local.md`, `docs/qa/gr3/phase1/`. | Compact screenshots (needs simulator access approval), physical-iPhone wallet backup and QR scan (GR-3.9), then GR-3.11 triage. |
| 2026-10-09 | GR-3 Phase 0 test bench | `codex/gr3-request-matrix` from `d4e1dbd1`; generators uncommitted on deeplink-sim `codex/gr3-generators` | Fresh iOS debug build from this checkout runs on two clean simulators (iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone SE). A disposable VRSCTEST profile exists with experimental requests on and 5 VRSCTEST funding. The app's key for `v2api.verustest.net` returns HTTP 401, so the profile uses the in-app Custom RPC override `https://api.verustest.net` (GR3-B0). A provisioning link opened with `simctl openurl` reaches the redesigned authentication review. deeplink-sim now generates app-encryption, identity-update, and negative requests (typecheck, 155 tests). Findings and screenshots: local `gr3-matrix.local.md` and `docs/qa/gr3/`. | Phase 0 done. The test VerusID is the reused daemon ID `liveqa09482856.antafri@` (update txid `48a95967…`), linked by discovery. Provisioning stays Blocked (Testnet DeFi outage, GR3-B1). Next: Phase 1 matrix. |
| 2026-10-09 | Upstream sync review fixes | Commit on `codex/sync` after merge `c615aabc` | The review found two dropped upstream warnings. Gift Card detail now shows an "Unfunded gift card" notice before an empty card is shared. It reuses the existing shared-notice block, and the card back keeps one short line. The Identity Update content step restores upstream's caveat that a removal can affect values added in the same update. It shows only for mixed content-map changes and uses the card inset. The legacy convert confirmation suite loads again with one `InvoicePaymentReview` mock. A mutation of the uncertain-broadcast guard fails 3 of its 15 cases. Design (30 sources), safe-area (3 files), no-undef lint, `git diff --check`, and 7 related suites (120 tests) pass. Synthetic iOS fixture captures on the real overview and content step cover unfunded, funded, and shared-empty cards and mixed and private-only content, in light and dark at compact and normal sizes. Captures are local in `docs/qa/merge-review-fixes/screenshots`. | Committed locally; no push. The other review findings remain open: confirm-step state fallback, inline lock explanation, wizard funding-error guide action, share after funding, the Android Media3 pin, and the glog privacy bundle. Android runtime and authenticated journeys remain unverified. |
| 2026-10-09 | Upstream sync with redesign preservation | `codex/sync`, based on `ccc0c256`, merges `dev-asf-parent` through `7d74cd6a` | Updated the four pinned Verus libraries together and integrated RN 0.77.3. Kept local layouts, shared primitives, themes, storage queues, and session guards. Adapted identity state/threshold review, content semantics, gift-card first-funding rules, and uncertain-broadcast protection to the redesign. Both native builds and both production JS bundles pass. Design (30 sources), targeted safe-area (5 files), parser (119 files), and focused flow checks pass. Six corrected/boundary suites pass 96 tests. The APK passes 16 KB ELF/ZIP checks for 34 libraries. Inspected 32 real-component iOS fixture captures across light/dark and normal/compact, plus actual production welcome in both themes. Corrected compact truncation of the new identity status labels. [Local receipt](docs/qa/upstream-sync/qa.local.md); [capture gallery](docs/qa/upstream-sync/gallery.local.html). | Ten imported UI suites are blocked by legacy native/theme mocks; no full-suite pass. Fixture captures do not prove authenticated journeys. Android runtime, live signing/transfers, existing-profile migration, NFC, and full accessibility remain unverified. Earlier GR/TX/RX/ID follow-ups and global QA checkboxes retain their recorded scope. No push. |
| 2026-09-12 | ID-1 final acceptance (scoped local delivery) | Committed as `33865cab` on `codex/id1-redesign` in worktree `/private/tmp/verus-mobile-id1-01a09345`; verified and review-ready, locally integrated into `codex/integrate-generic-request-upstream` | Final verification of the ID-1 candidate. The parent independently ran 10 focused ID-1 suites (63 tests), `git diff --check`, Babel parse for all 9 changed production JS files, design contract (30 canonical sources), safe-area (9 files), search-field (15 files), identity-authority funding (PASS), and GenericRequest completion flow (9 cases). A task-owned iOS release fixture bundle compiled from the actual candidate (26 assets), and synthetic disposable VRSCTEST states were exercised on a normal 402x874 simulator and a compact iPhone SE with light/dark captures, covering no identities, several identities, long names, discovery loading/empty/error, the always-reachable manual fallback, manual validation/lookup/resolved review/failure, processing single-flight with blocked dismissal/Back, pending error/progress/READY actions, details loading/error/long values, separate accessible `CopyAction` nodes and copied feedback, unlink cancellation/failure (unlink remains a local association change only), and the rebuilt final details spot check. Native QA found a manual-row clipping, corrected before the final capture. The same and only independent Astra high-risk reviewer returned READY with all original and follow-up findings closed; the complete before/after state guard was 1,702 files, no exclusions, identical. Parent-owned visual QA applied the canonical SH-1/onboarding patterns at normal/compact and light/dark; because the user required exactly one independent reviewer, no second design-adviser reviewer was added, and the single reviewer explicitly applied `max-product-design-taste` while reviewing the final renders. Proof limits: fixture data and API are synthetic and cannot sign, spend, move funds, expose a real key, or prove live RPC or authenticated-wallet behavior, and callback or session authentication is not transaction or settlement proof; native proof is iOS only. Android runtime, full VoiceOver/TalkBack, exhaustive text scaling/reduced motion, and authenticated disposable-wallet mutation remain explicitly unverified follow-up, not implied passes. Node was 22.18.0 because the requested 22.23.2 was unavailable; checks used the canonical sibling `node_modules`, and no source depends on it. | ID-1.10–1.11 complete for the scoped local delivery. ID-1 is verified and review-ready, committed as `33865cab` and locally integrated into `codex/integrate-generic-request-upstream`; `origin/codex/integrate-generic-request-upstream` remains behind until a separately authorized push. Global QA-1 stays open for the other workstreams. |
| 2026-09-12 | ID-1 final lifecycle corrections (two P2 defects) | Uncommitted local delivery over `a607faf6` on `codex/id1-redesign` in worktree `/private/tmp/verus-mobile-id1-01a09345`; the parent owns the commit and the rendered/native QA | Corrects the two reproduced P2 lifecycle defects from the same independent high-risk reviewer (five earlier findings already closed). (1) The unlink confirmation's delayed `goBack` callback now passes the immutable `requestContext.sessionScope` captured when the unlink started instead of the per-render `renderedSessionScopeRef`, keeping the mounted/focused-route/route-key checks. (2) `SignedInVerusIdService` now owns its READY-resume single-flight flag through the new `createVerusIdResumeOwner` guard (`verusIdFlowGuards.js`), which binds the in-flight flag/token to the session scope and releases the gate synchronously on an account-hash or session-epoch change, so an unresolved run cannot lock later READY actions; stale `catch`/`finally` stay inert. New focused regression coverage exercises the real queued callback and handler with deferred promises (`SignedInVerusIdLifecycle` 4, plus `verusIdFlowGuards` resume-owner cases now 15) and each defect was separately reverted by mutation to confirm the tests fail. The 10 focused ID-1 suites pass (63 tests). Babel parse (5 files), `git diff --check`, design contract (30 canonical sources), `check-safe-areas --changed` (9 files), `check-search-fields --changed` (15 files), `check-generic-request-completion-flow` (9 cases), and `check-identity-authority-funding` pass. HEAD unchanged at `a607faf6`; dependencies resolved through a temporary `NODE_PATH` to the sibling checkout (no source change depends on it). | ID-1.10–1.11 stay open for the parent: rendered light/dark normal/compact empty/error/keyboard/processing captures, the independent design-adviser pass, and the same reviewer's re-closure of these two corrections before acceptance and commit. |
| 2026-09-12 | ID-1 high-risk review corrections | Uncommitted local delivery over `a607faf6` on `codex/id1-redesign` in worktree `/private/tmp/verus-mobile-id1-01a09345`; the parent owns the commit and the rendered/native QA | Correction of the six blocking findings from the single independent high-risk review. New `src/utils/verusid/verusIdFlowGuards.js` holds the shared, tested decisions: candidate origin capture/match, pending-status-sheet dismissal, and the delayed-unlink navigation guard. `LinkExistingVerusIdSheet` binds discovery and manual lookup to the account hash plus login epoch, checks the scope after every await and before linking, and stamps immutable origin metadata on each candidate; `AuthenticationRequestInfo`, `AppEncryptionRequestInfo`, and `SignedInVerusIdService` revalidate the candidate's primary R-address against the current account's VRPC addresses and reject a stale origin. `processVerusId` now takes a backward-compatible optional guard checked after the storage await and before every dispatch/navigation; the signed-in service supplies the captured session plus a synchronous operation token, and retry/READY resume are single-flight with no stale dispatch, navigation, fallback reopen, state clearing, or cross-session error. The queued unlink `goBack` re-checks the originating session and focused route at execution time. A status sheet that becomes READY closes instead of showing false `In progress` copy. The Authentication passthrough fallback and the touched manual routes use the shared manual sheet with a prefilled FQN; no touched ID-1 path opens the legacy SendModal link UI. `IdentityPickerSheet` Back now guards on the synchronous `linkBusyRef`. Focused Jest suites added: `verusIdFlowGuards` (12), `processVerusIdResumeGuard` (4), `id1LinkFailureRouting` (2), and `IdentityPickerSheet` (3, including the ref-guard case confirmed to fail against the prior state-based Back guard). The four new suites plus 11 relevant existing suites pass (15 suites / 79 tests); Babel parse for the changed/new JS files, `git diff --check`, design contract (30 canonical sources), `check-safe-areas` (6 files), `check-search-fields --changed` (14 files), `check-generic-request-completion-flow` (9 cases), and `check-identity-authority-funding` pass. | ID-1.10–1.11 remain open: no rendered or native capture exists for the corrected manual/review/pending/unlink/details states, and the parent must re-run the independent high-risk and design reviews on this corrected candidate before acceptance and commit. This pass added no simulator/fixture files. Verification used a temporary `node_modules` symlink to the sibling checkout because this worktree has no installed dependencies and the sandboxed pnpm store is not writable; no source change depends on it. |
| 2026-09-12 | ID-1 correction adoption and verification pass | Uncommitted local delivery over `a607faf6` on `codex/id1-redesign` in worktree `/private/tmp/verus-mobile-id1-01a09345`; the parent owns the commit and the rendered/native QA | The prior correction candidate was inspected as untrusted work and re-verified against all six blockers; no production source needed changing, only the focused suites were tightened. `verusIdFlowGuards` (12) exhaustively covers stale origin/epoch rejection and the shared-first-address switch, READY/removed status-sheet dismissal, and the four delayed-unlink navigation rejections. `processVerusIdResumeGuard` (6) now also fails if the guard is not re-checked between each `dispatch`/storage await and the navigation, after the pre-navigation guard was confirmed present and then re-confirmed by mutation. `IdentityPickerSheet` (3) covers origin metadata on the discovered candidate, the same-frame Back block, and the blocked backdrop/system close, each proven to fail when its guard is removed. `id1LinkFailureRouting` (2) stays a structural source assertion that the touched consumers do not open the legacy SendModal link UI. Focused correction suites plus the existing ID-1 session/provisioning/notification suites: 10 suites / 62 tests. `git diff --check`, Babel parse on all 14 changed/new JS files, design contract (30 canonical sources), `check-safe-areas` (9 files), `check-search-fields --changed` (14 files), `check-generic-request-completion-flow` (9 cases), and `check-identity-authority-funding` pass. HEAD unchanged at `a607faf6`; dependencies were resolved through a temporary `NODE_PATH` to the sibling checkout (no source change depends on it). | ID-1.10–1.11 stay open for the parent: rendered and native light/dark normal/compact captures, the independent high-risk behavior re-review, and the design-adviser pass on this corrected candidate before acceptance and commit. |
| 2026-09-12 | ID-1 VerusID linking, details, and status implementation | Uncommitted local delivery over `a607faf6` on `codex/id1-redesign` in worktree `/private/tmp/verus-mobile-id1-01a09345`; the parent owns the commit and the rendered/native QA | Manual entry, validation, resolution, review, linking, and failure now live in the shared `LinkExistingVerusIdSheet`, so the touched consumers never open the legacy SendModal link flow; identity resolution is read-only and never requests seeds. Pending status and unlink confirmation are floating shared sheets with refresh/retry primary, removal/unlink secondary, controls disabled while processing, `onClosed` cleanup and navigation, and local-only unlink copy. Signed-in details leads with the name, status, network, and identifiers, keeps warnings and full values, collapses technical sections, uses inline `CopyAction`, and drops the unsupported “No attestations linked” section. `git diff --check` clean; design contract (30 canonical sources), `check-safe-areas` for the 5 changed files, Babel parse (5 changed files), relative-import resolution, `check-generic-request-completion-flow` (9 cases) and `check-identity-authority-funding` pass. | ID-1.10–1.11 remain open: no rendered or native capture exists for the new manual/review/pending/unlink/details states, and no independent design or behavior review has run on this candidate. `corepack pnpm` could not execute in this worktree (no installed `node_modules`), so the check scripts were run directly with `node`. Next: the parent captures iOS/Android light/dark normal/compact states and runs the required reviews before accepting. |
| 2026-09-12 | RX-1 accepted local delivery | Task-owned delivery over `19a5ede5` on `codex/integrate-generic-request-upstream`; exact commit in the local QA receipt | Full-screen request flow with the system decimal amount keypad, native subject/slippage fields, safe footer, preserved invoice/share contracts, and operation-bound cancel/save behavior. 32/32 independent focused checks pass; design (30 canonical sources), safe-area, parser, both native preview bundles and production iOS bundle pass. 196 native gallery captures include 120 static Receive/canonical states plus request, keyboard, error, cancellation, save, copy/selection and scrolled states across iOS/Android normal/compact and light/dark. Native copied change address matches the full fixture value; native QR images decode; QR save succeeds on both platforms. Same high-risk reviewer and design adviser are READY with no unresolved findings; full source guards identical (2,970 files, six generated/cache exclusions). [Screenshot gallery](docs/rx1-qa-20260911/index.html); [QA and commit receipt](docs/rx1-qa-20260911/qa.local.md) | RX-1.8–1.9 complete for disposable-fixture delivery.

Full VoiceOver/TalkBack, exhaustive text scaling and native reduced-motion settings remain QA-1 follow-up; sampled native and shared-source evidence are recorded. |
| 2026-09-11 | RX-1 Receive and payment-request implementation + correction passes | Uncommitted local delivery over `19a5ede5` on `codex/integrate-generic-request-upstream`; the parent commits after acceptance | Full-screen stepped payment-request task, platform monospace addresses, accurate Card/address states, `beforeRemove` parity with header back, stale-completion invalidation and single-flight create/QR-save guards. Corrections after an independent high-risk review: operation-bound QR save completion (a late save cannot mark a newer request saved, attach its failure or clear a newer guard) and a real cancel path while generation is pending (header back and `Cancel` invalidate generation identity before leaving; no stranded loading). Preview fixtures now use distinct per-Card address channels and real system i-addresses, and the harness gives details/wizard a real previous route with an optional chrome-free launch state. 27 focused non-Jest behaviour checks pass, including the real-StackRouter route-removal checks, the deferred-per-save CameraRoll checks, the actual preview fixture dataset and the actual preview invoice stub driving the real encoder/decoder; design check (30 canonical sources), safe-area, Babel parse (5 files) and production iOS bundle (46 assets) pass; both preview bundles compile and the production bundle contains no fixture references. The independent high-risk reviewer passed that candidate with no findings. [Local RX-1 QA](docs/rx1-qa-20260911/qa.local.md); [preview harness](docs/rx1-qa-20260911/index.js) | Superseded by the 2026-09-12 native-QA corrections below. RX-1.8–1.9 stay open. |
| 2026-09-12 | RX-1 native-QA corrections (third pass) | Uncommitted local delivery over `19a5ede5` on `codex/integrate-generic-request-upstream`; the parent commits after acceptance | Two production corrections taken from actual native screenshots: the absent-address row is now a wrapping body sentence with no copy affordance, while real addresses keep identifier typography and the copy control; and the payment-request flow reserves Android keyboard space (`KeyboardAvoidingView` `height` under the manifest's `adjustPan`) so the subject and slippage footers stay reachable, with iOS keeping `padding`. Fixture-only repairs: the preview store now processes `PUSH_MODAL`/`REMOVE_MODAL` through the production modal reducer and seeds `state.modal.stack`, so sheets no longer crash the native modal chain; the list loading scenario now uses the real pre-Card-directory loading contract instead of rendering an empty list; and two new scenarios mount the **real** `GiftCardFund` screen (fund and create modes) with an exact synthetic Card, a real funding coin/VRPC source address/ledger balance, and an origin-scoped inert service-storage stub that cannot read a password or keychain entry. 30 focused non-Jest checks pass, including three new guards each verified to fail against the pre-fix code; design check (30 canonical sources), safe-area checks (3 changed, 8 Transfer), Babel parse (10 files), preview iOS/Android bundles and the production iOS bundle (46 assets, 0 fixture references) pass. [Local RX-1 QA](docs/rx1-qa-20260911/qa.local.md) | RX-1.8–1.9 remain open. Native proof is partial: the parent captured iOS normal and iPhone SE compact surfaces plus Android amount/subject/settings/result and decoded each result QR (one QR per result, 158 characters), but the sheet scenarios and the canonical Gift Card comparison have not been captured on a device yet, and no independent review verdict exists for this corrected candidate. Next: parent re-captures the corrected matrix, compares against the real Gift Card screen, then runs the same report-only reviews and commits. |
| 2026-09-12 | RX-1 native amount keypad (fourth pass) | Uncommitted local delivery over `19a5ede5` on `codex/integrate-generic-request-upstream`; the parent commits after acceptance | User-requested amount change: the custom on-screen `NumericKeypad` is removed from `ReceivePaymentRequestFlow` and replaced by the shared editable `AppTextInput` with `keyboardType="decimal-pad"`/`inputMode="decimal"`, the same native input and keyboard mechanism as the slippage field and canonical `GiftCardFund`. The amount autofocuses on entry and on return, keeps the currency beside the field, the fiat estimate and the fiat/coin switch, and adds `maxLength` plus a plain-decimal guard (`isPlainAmountInput`/`getAmountInputError`) so a pasted `1e5`/`0x10` cannot validate. Amount, currency, switch, estimate, validation and step semantics are unchanged, as are single-flight generation, save binding, cancel and back handling. 32 focused non-Jest checks pass (two new: the plain-decimal guard and the native field shape/paste guard); design check (30 canonical sources), safe-area check (2 changed files), Babel parse (2 files), preview iOS (25 assets) and Android (27 assets) bundles and the production iOS bundle (46 assets, 0 fixture references) pass. [Local RX-1 QA](docs/rx1-qa-20260911/qa.local.md) | RX-1.8–1.9 remain open. Parent still owns the final native amount captures (iOS normal/SE-compact, Android normal, light/dark), the sheet/canonical comparisons, the independent high-risk and design reviews, and the commit.

| 2026-09-11 | SH-1 shared selection and information sheets | Local delivery over `51672964` on `codex/integrate-generic-request-upstream`; exact commit in the local QA report | Nine migrated sheets; canonical identity/Card/request-details regression evidence. 133 native gallery entries plus seven before captures cover iOS/Android, light/dark, normal/compact and focused loading/error/keyboard/overflow states. Design, safe-area, parser, focused dismissal/selection checks and production iOS bundle pass. Independent design and behavior reviews are ready, with unchanged repository guards.

Authenticated wallet journeys and full VoiceOver/TalkBack traversal remain with the owning TX-1/RX-1/ID-1 and QA-1 tasks. Next scoped implementation: remaining TX-1 work when authorized. |
| 2026-09-10 | GR-1 Android QA and layout corrections | Task-owned candidate over `4decf026` | Android native build/entry and 41 fixture screenshots recorded. Corrected tall details-sheet overflow and kept signing errors beside the action. Native iOS/Android light/dark, normal/compact layout and consent/failure checks pass; design, safe-area, parser and iOS bundle checks pass.

The original overflow reproduced on Android; the normal iOS baseline already fit. |
| 2026-09-10 | GR-1 / GR-2 local implementation | Task-owned candidate over `75592c0f` on `codex/integrate-generic-request-upstream` | Shared themed credential/Data Packet review; explicit consent; cached completion retry; authoritative session/lifecycle/expiry guards before signing. Design/safe-area/parser/iOS bundle, focused non-Jest state/delivery checks, and harness contract checks pass. iOS fixture render/interaction evidence and independent review records: [local QA report](gr12-qa.local.md) | GR-1.9–1.10 and GR-2.6 remain open for authenticated native callbacks/mixed-order walkthrough, Android, and remaining accessibility evidence.

| 2026-10-17 | I-21, A-29/I-30, A-28 history tap/detail | `claude/fix-history-tap-detail` from `5cbbac30`; `SignedInActionBar.js`, `TxDetailsModal.js` | Native `View` with `pointerEvents="none"` wraps the edge-fade SVG, using the existing `ScrollEdgeFade` pattern. Source layout places the invisible 32-point top fade over the first 60-point row. Installed iOS SVG hit testing lacks the native View pointer-events guard; Android checks it before SVG traversal. Conversion Type bypasses title-case transformation only for conversions. Dark header uses sheet/border/text roles, and Details uses readable enabled/disabled text; light colors and explorer availability stay unchanged. Temporary non-Jest source/component checks: 16 baseline failures, 34/34 candidate passes. Babel parse (three JS files, including the reverted preliminary zIndex change), design (30 sources), and whitespace checks pass. [Layout trace and evidence limits](history-tap-detail-qa.local.md). | High-confidence source diagnosis, not native proof. Supplied screenshots inspected read-only.

| 2026-10-17 | TX-1 context band: Amount/Recipient route reminder | `claude/wizard-context-band` from `4da25b17`; new `WizardContextBand.js`, `getWizardContextSummary` in `wizardUtils.js`, `context` slot in `SendWizardHeader.js`, `SendWizardNavigator.js`, `labelSm` in `tokens.js`; old `contextLine` removed from `SendWizardAmount.js` | Contract: reuse `SendWizardHeader`, `AssetCoinLogo`, theme roles and `surfaceMuted`; no card, no eyebrow. Owner chose option C from the HTML review (2026-10-17) and approved the rules: show on Amount and Recipient, not on Confirm or Success (they already show source, target and Destination network); chain only when it is not the coin's own chain; Send to another chain shows the coin alone on Amount (the Network row names the chain) and adds the chain on Recipient. Model check (temporary Node script, Babel with repo config, stubbed CoinDirectory): 13 cases pass for convert same/other chain on both steps, send same/other chain on both steps, no Network row, `[ERC20]` removal, badge rule, missing route. Babel parse (6 files), `check:design` (30 sources), `check:safe-areas --changed`, and `git diff --check` pass. Rendered on iOS 26.5 simulator (Verus GR3 QA, 402x874pt, Testnet profile, PTest iOS wallet): Convert VRSCTEST to GOLD on Amount (keyboard open, estimate loaded) and Recipient; Convert to DAI on Ethereum on Amount in light and dark; Send on Amount with the Network row for Verus Testnet and for Ethereum. A temporary 140-point squeeze (reverted) showed the chain name shortening to "E…" while asset names stayed whole. The accessibility tree exposes one text element, "Send VRSCTEST", after the header. | Not verified: iPhone SE 375pt and Android 360dp (SE simulator has no unlockable wallet; the Android emulator has no testnet wallet), large Dynamic Type (no change seen when set, inconclusive), Send to another chain on Recipient (the Ethereum fee exceeds the 14.18 VRSCTEST balance), light/dark on Recipient, long names on device. Observed: on Amount for a same-chain Send the band repeats the coin named in the Available line; owner decided to keep the band there (2026-10-18). Committed on the task branch. TX-1.8/TX-1.9 remain open. |
| 2026-10-18 | Integration: context band and private-testnet follow-ups into `redesign` | `redesign` `9249b82b4` (merge of `claude/private-testnet-followups` `ca7f8208`, which merged `claude/wizard-context-band` `83933b6f`) | Owner kept the band, including the coin-only band on Amount for a same-chain Send. `check:design` (30 sources) and safe-areas pass on `redesign`. Rendered on iOS 26.5 simulator (Verus GR3 QA, 402x874pt, Testnet profile, private chain, PTest iOS wallet, Metro serving the `redesign` checkout), from the app: Convert VRSCTEST to GOLD 0.05 (route VRSC-KMD-GOLD), Send GOLD 0.01 to self, Convert GOLD to VRSCTEST 0.02 (route VRSC-GOLD), Send VRSCTEST 0.01 to a saved address. The band shows on Amount and Recipient, and not on Confirm or Success. `getrawtransaction` on ptestapi shows all four mined (blocks 35763, 35772, 35772, 35777). Balances in the app match the Confirm previews and chain results (final 14.14044575 VRSCTEST, 0.12996854 GOLD); history lists the conversions, the sends and the conversion proceeds. Dark mode checked on Amount and Recipient (Send VRSCTEST). | Not verified: iPhone SE 375pt, Android 360dp, Send to another chain on Recipient (the Ethereum fee exceeds the balance), long names on device, large Dynamic Type. The app process died once during an agent-device tap on the wallet home (known XCUITest limit there); a relaunch and login restored it. TX-1.CONTEXT-BAND-QA stays open. Pushed to `origin/redesign` (2026-10-18, `593795eb`). |
| 2026-10-18 | TX-1 history: label conversion proceeds | `claude/conversion-proceeds-label` from `593795eb`; `updates.js` (`readImport`, `resolveCurrencyName`, `conversionProceeds`), `standardizeTxObj.js`, `Overview.js`, `TxDetailsModal.js` | Finding: the proceeds of a conversion are paid in a later block by a chain-made import transaction. The address-delta response gives a received output no marker at any verbosity ptestapi accepts (`sent.outputs` exists only on spends), so the transaction itself must be read. Chain data (private chain, `getrawtransaction`): both proceeds transactions (`66f46faf4f5d` block 35765, `5e06971b3fc7` block 35774) have a `crosschainimport` output at index 0 with `sourcesystemid` equal to the wallet's own system; the import's `valuein` lists the source currency and, when the fee uses the received currency, that currency as well. Rule: a received (non-spend) transaction with an import from the wallet's own system is conversion proceeds; the source is the single `valuein` currency other than the received one, else the label is "Conversion proceeds". Imports from another system are not labeled (a bridge arrival has the same shape and the transfer's convert flag is not in the import). Reads are cached by txid and capped at 25 new transactions per update (history refresh runs every 60 s on the Overview). Real `updateVrpcTransactions` run in Node against ptestapi (network wrappers only replaced): VRSCTEST 3 proceeds rows and GOLD 2, each pair matching its sent conversion (USD to VRSCTEST at 33562, VRSC-USD to VRSCTEST at 33572, GOLD to VRSCTEST at 35774, VRSCTEST to GOLD at 34183 and 35765); 0 of 17 plain receipts labeled; a second pass re-reads no receipt already read. Rendered on iOS 26.5 simulator (Testnet profile, private chain, PTest iOS wallet): Verus Testnet history shows "Converted from GOLD" (+0.01998497), the +2000 funding row still reads "My transparent address", the sent row still reads "Convert to VRSCTEST"; the transaction sheet shows Type "Conversion from GOLD" with TxID `5e06971b3fc7…`; GOLD history shows "Converted from VRSCTEST" twice and "Convert to VRSCTEST". Babel parse (4 files), `check:design` (30 sources), `git diff --check` pass. | Not verified: Android; dark mode on the changed rows; cross-system conversions (not labeled by design); a wallet with more than 25 unread receipts on a real device (checked by the capped Node run only); a failed read for 25 or more transactions in a row would hide older rows from lookup until they succeed. No Jest test added (project rule). |
| 2026-10-18 | TX-1 UX round 2: network groups, Amount "say it in money", Recipient rows, Confirm/Sent spine | `claude/send-convert-ux-round-2` from `redesign` `4462c81f`; commits `7249d53f`, `49f7fcbe`, `149814f0`, `6ebb54c0`. New `priceImpact.js`, `usePriceImpact.js`, `useWizardFiat.js`, `components/{AmountEstimate,ImpactRow,ConfirmFacts,TransferSummary,TransferDetailsSheet,impactFormat}.js`; changed `SelectionSheets.js`, `SendWizardAmount/Recipient/Confirm/Success.js`, `SendWizardContext.js`, `WizardUI.js` (`FlatRow`), `wizardUtils.js`, `StatusBadge.js` (danger tone), `DESIGN.md` | Contract: the owner chose network option 1 (groups), Amount option C, Recipient option A, Confirm and Sent option B from the 2026-10-18 HTML mockups. Impact = shortfall against the output per unit of a small sample trade (about one display-currency unit) on the same route, fetched once per route; tiers 0.1/1/5%; the suggestion is verified by a real quote. Checks: Babel parse and an ESLint subset (`no-undef`, `no-unused-vars`, rules-of-hooks) on all changed files, `check:design` (30), `check:safe-areas`, `check:send-wizard-options`, diff whitespace, Metro bundle. Worked example (CPMM, depth 8,000, spot 1.84): 25/250/1,000 give 0.31/3.03/11.11%, suggestion 240 measures 2.9%. Rendered on iOS 26.5 simulator (Verus GR3 QA, 402x874pt, private chain, PTest iOS) by Sonnet 5.5 testers in four passes: run 1 on `7249d53f` 15 PASS, 0 FAIL, 1 BLOCKED (fiat mode); the retest on `49f7fcbe` fixed D1 (suggestion label cut), D2 (keypad after the network sheet; `useFocusEffect` now focuses the field), D6/D7/D10/D11 (copy, notice contrast, money decimals); two more passes on `149814f0` and `6ebb54c0` fixed D3 (recipient name in the receive node: name over "receives", shortened once). Three small private-testnet transactions were sent through Hold to confirm and confirmed on the chain (conversions of 0.05 VRSCTEST to USD and to Bridge.vETH, one 0.01 send). Evidence: `docs/qa/send-convert-ux-round-2/` (`ios`, `ios-retest`, `ios-retest2`, `ios-retest3`, `report.local.html`) | Not verified: iPhone SE and 360dp, fiat mode and fiat captions (no VRSCTEST price on the private chain), exact 0.1/1/5% boundaries, Destination network for a cross-chain conversion, the multi-address Send to self sheet, Bridge transaction sent, long VerusID names, large text. Pre-existing and left alone: "Bridge" ticker shortening in some rows, stale Recipient text after a network change, two taps in the Convert to list while the search keyboard is open, VRSCTEST logo edge in dark mode. Round 3 (2026-10-19, commits `952b7909`, `bb9beb03`, `38ca9b45`, `968ab9e9`): the Via row and the price-impact wording; iOS and Android (fresh disposable "PTest Android" wallet on Pixel_8_API_35, funded with 700 VRSCTEST from "PTest iOS"; one 700 VRSCTEST funding send and two conversions of 0.05 VRSCTEST on the private chain, all confirmed). iOS: 8 PASS, 1 FAIL in the first pass, all PASS after the fixes. Android: 16 PASS, 2 FAIL in the first pass, all PASS after the fixes. Found and fixed: Confirm lost its Price impact row when the already selected basket was picked again (`setRoute` cleared `marketPrice`; now kept for the same route key and re-asserted by `usePriceImpact`); the high-impact block clipped the suggestion row (money line two lines at most, tighter rows); the Android keyboard did not return after a sheet closed (a focus toggle at 0.9 s closed a showing keyboard; `Keyboard.isVisible()` is unreliable because the window pans; final fix toggles focus only after the Via or Network sheet closes and once when Amount opens right after the Convert to network sheet; 5 paths x 2 runs on Android). The Android app had loaded old code from the other dev server until `debug_http_host` was set; that preference was removed again. Evidence: `docs/qa/send-convert-ux-round-2/` (`ios-r3`, `ios-r3b`, `ios-r3c`, `android-r3` to `android-r3d`, `report.local.html`). Merged into `redesign` with `--no-ff` (`38bffae1`) and pushed. Not verified: iPhone SE and 360dp (run later the same day, see the next row), fiat money text, Send to another chain on Confirm, long VerusID names, large text. TX-1.UX2-QA stays open. |
| 2026-10-19 | TX-1 small-device run and pinned Amount estimate | `claude/send-convert-pin-estimate` from `redesign` `38bffae1`; `WizardUI.js` (`pinned` slot in `WizardFormLayout`), `AmountEstimate.js` (pinned block, compact variant, exported `RouteRow`), `SendWizardAmount.js`, `DESIGN.md` | Run first: Sonnet 5.5 testers (medium effort) ran SM-0 to SM-10 on `38bffae1` on the iPhone SE simulator (375x667 pt, "Verus GR3 Compact") and the Android AVD `Small_360x640` (720x1280 at 320 dpi); all passed, one real 0.05 VRSCTEST to GOLD conversion on each (SE tx `6a9bcbe9`, 5 confirmations; Android 360 tx confirmed later in the wallet history). Main finding: with the keypad open the receive row, money line, badge, suggestion and Via row sat below the fold and needed a scroll (SE: 80 to 110 pt scroll area; 360dp: 163 dp for scroll area plus footer). Contract: the owner chose "pin it". The estimate now sits above Continue in a `pinned` slot of the footer, outside the scroll area, on every screen size. On a window of 667 pt or less (`useOnboardingSmallDeviceLayout`): less top spacing above the amount and chip, no unit price line, the impact badge beside "You receive" (logo omitted) so the money line stays on one line, and the Via row in the scroll content while a warning shows. The receive amount shrinks to 80% instead of wrapping. Checks: `check:design`, `check:safe-areas`, Metro bundle on both devices. Rendered (light; dark on SE and 360dp): iPhone SE, Android 360x640, iPhone 17 Pro (402x874 pt): DAI 200 (8.3% warning with suggestion), DAI 68 (3.0%), GOLD 0.05 (Via, Best price), DAI to Ethereum (network fee row), empty field (Market price), invalid amount, tap on the suggestion keeps the keypad, Back from Recipient. Android "0 after backspace" report: reproduced as a caret artifact (text "10", caret one step left, backspace leaves a real "0", "5" then gives "50"), not a product defect; plain backspace to empty and typing again is correct. Evidence: `docs/qa/send-convert-ux-round-2/` (`ios-se`, `android-360`, `pin`). | Not verified: fiat money text, large text, Confirm and Sent after the change (not touched), 360dp light and dark for every state. Left open from the small-device run: Confirm notice under the Hold button and Sent "Transaction ID" under Done on 360dp; MAX pill and "Available" row clipped by an error card on SE; Confirm connector wraps inside "VRSC-KMD-GOLD"; "Bridge" shown for Bridge.vETH; unit chip is dead without a fiat price; the chip and "Available / MAX" can be partly under the pinned block on short screens (reachable by scroll). TX-1.UX2-QA stays open. |
| 2026-10-19 | TX-1 polish round 3: Bridge.vETH name, Sent without stepper, Confirm loading and notices, fee sheet | `claude/send-convert-polish-3` from `redesign` `1c53d32c`; `wizardUtils.js` (`getCurrencyDisplay` fallback), `SendWizardHeader.js` (`showProgress`), `SendWizardNavigator.js`, `FeeBreakdownSheet.js`, `SendWizardConfirm.js`, `SendWizardSuccess.js`, `SendWizardAmount.js`, `WizardUI.js` (`above` slot of `WizardFooter`), `TransferSummary.js` (`loading`, connector lines), new `ConfirmPreparing.js`, `DESIGN.md` | Contract: owner feedback of 2026-10-19. (1) A Bridge keeps its full name: the fallback of `getCurrencyDisplay` cut "Bridge.vETH" at the first dot when the currency was not yet in the coin directory; now "Bridge" keeps its full name. Rendered in the network sheet, context band, receive row, Confirm and Sent. The owner wrote "Bridge.bETH"; the chain name is "Bridge.vETH" and the app uses that. (2) Sent has no progress bar. (3) The fee sheet subtitle is gone. (4) Confirm while preparing draws the review as it will look: real pay node, recipient and "To"; skeleton receive amount, connector, price impact, fees, arrives; button "Preparing…" (disabled). The old centred skeleton and its two lines of text are removed. (5) Confirm warnings and errors sit above Hold (`above` slot); the fact list uses `FadedScrollView`. (6) Sent on a window of 667 pt or less: less top spacing, 48 pt check, 24 pt footer spacing, so the Transaction ID shows above Done on 360dp. (7) The unit chip shows only when the paid asset has a fiat price. (8) The Confirm connector draws the unit price and the route on two lines, so "VRSC-KMD-GOLD" no longer breaks. Checks: `check:design`, `check:safe-areas`, `check:send-wizard-options`, Metro bundle on all three devices. Rendered and exercised (light; dark for the loading state): iPhone SE, Android 360x640 and iPhone 17 Pro, each with a real 0.05 VRSCTEST to GOLD conversion through Hold to confirm to Sent (SE also a 1 VRSCTEST to Bridge.vETH conversion; the wallet then listed 172.9318 Bridge.vETH under its full name); Android tx `1147ebae…` seen with `convert: true` in the mempool. Evidence: `docs/qa/send-convert-ux-round-2/polish3/`. | Not verified: dark mode of every Confirm and Sent state, Confirm preparing on the slowest networks (a real preflight took under 5 s here), large text, fiat money text. Decision left for the owner: wait on the Recipient button instead of a Confirm skeleton (see the reply). TX-1.UX2-QA stays open. |
| 2026-10-19 | TX-1 declutter Confirm and Sent (owner feedback, second pass) | `claude/send-convert-declutter` from `redesign` `cfd125a6`; `SendWizardConfirm.js`, `SendWizardSuccess.js`, `SendWizardNavigator.js` (`headerShown: false` on Sent), `ConfirmFacts.js`, `ConfirmPreparing.js`, `TransferSummary.js`, `SendWizardHeader.js`, `wizardUtils.js`, `DESIGN.md`; deleted `TransferDetailsSheet.js` | Contract: owner feedback of 2026-10-19. The recipient shows once on Confirm, in full, in the "To" row; the pay and receive nodes carry only "You pay" and "You receive" and the amounts. "More details" and its sheet are gone (they repeated "To" and "From"). The preflight notice "This conversion involves a centrally controlled currency" is not shown any more (the notices for a missing estimate and for a lower latest estimate stay). Sent has no header at all (no close button, no divider, no progress bar), no "To" row and no "Arrives" row; Done leaves. A long amount uses a 17 pt font so the label and the ticker never clip on 360 dp; the amount and ticker are separate texts. Checks: `check:design`, `check:safe-areas`, `check:send-wizard-options`, Metro bundle on the iPhone SE simulator and the Android 360x640 emulator. Exercised with real 0.05 and 0.058 VRSCTEST to GOLD conversions through Hold to confirm to Sent on both devices (SE tx `4b055d29…`, Android tx `042004ea…`); DAI 200 Confirm on the SE without sending. Evidence: `docs/qa/send-convert-ux-round-2/declutter/`. | Not verified: iPhone 17 Pro for this pass, dark mode of Confirm and Sent, cross-chain Confirm, VerusID recipients. The Amount-step variations are mockups only (`TX-1.AMOUNT-DECLUTTER`). TX-1.UX2-QA stays open. |
| 2026-10-19 | TX-1 Amount declutter: receive line and Price and route chip | `claude/send-convert-price-route-chip` from `redesign` `f46049f5`; `SendWizardAmount.js`, `AmountEstimate.js`, new `PriceRouteSheet.js`, `SelectionSheets.js`, `DESIGN.md` | Contract: owner chose A2. Amount pins one receive line and one tappable percent chip when impact is at least 0.1%, more than one basket exists, or an Ethereum export fee is relevant. Empty/invalid amounts pin nothing; loading uses one skeleton line. The chip replaces the logo, uses neutral/warning/danger at 0.1/1/5%, and opens Price and route. `InfoSheet` supplies the 78% shell, one `SheetScrollView` with the established measured fade/chevron cue, and fixed 56-point secondary Done. Price, sorted basket choices or single Via, Ethereum fee loading/value/unavailable, and the unfilled suggestion action share that scroll body. Route and suggestion callbacks run after closing through `useSheetDismissal`; route side effects, Android refocus, form errors, Continue gating, fiat loss text, and fee quote/MAX logic stay in place. The old Amount Via row, compact badge/logo split, and RouteSheet are removed. Checks: `check:design` (30 canonical sources), `check:safe-areas --changed` (4 files), `check:send-wizard-options`, `git diff --check`, and the complete dev iOS JS bundle pass (49 assets; environment color warnings only). Temporary non-Jest Node fixtures pass 48 cases: thresholds, light/dark props, one-line skeleton, money/fiat/unknown-price data, route and suggestion post-close actions, rapid reopen, fee states, and the overflow cue with 24 baskets. Focused scope/hooks check: three component files pass; Amount reports the same five existing hook diagnostics as the baseline, with unchanged hook order by source inspection. | Device QA (orchestrator, 2026-10-19): two Sonnet 5.5 testers ran `docs/qa/send-convert-ux-round-2/checklist-chip.local.md` on the iPhone SE simulator (375x667 pt), the iPhone 17 Pro simulator (402x874 pt) and the Android `Small_360x640` emulator (360x640 dp), light and dark, evidence in `chip-ios/` and `chip-android/`. All checks CH-0 to CH-15 pass except one defect found on Android and fixed in `0ad7ba3e` (retested on all three devices: pass): with a long ticker (Bridge.vETH) and the chip showing, the receive amount was missing; the amount now keeps its width and the chip wraps under "You receive". Also fixed: the pinned loading skeleton is one row; basket rows in the sheet read their badge in the accessibility label. Real transactions: 0.05 VRSCTEST to GOLD with the non-best basket VRSC-GOLD picked by hand (iOS `fb7ec014…`, Android `583bd6b2…`, both `via` `iECDGNNu…` = VRSC-GOLD on the chain) and one with the default basket (`f0fae884…`, `via` `iMZHZto3…` = VRSC-KMD-GOLD). A temporary local patch with ten baskets showed the sheet scrolling, the fade and chevron cue while rows remain below, no cue at the end, and Done always visible (light and dark, all three devices); the patch was reverted. Confirm keeps its "Arrives" row (owner decision). | Not verified: the sheet's fee skeleton (the quote was cached), the "Details" chip (the private chain always has a market price), VoiceOver speech, large text, fiat money text. Known and left: the suggestion row appears only from 5% impact (existing rule in `usePriceImpact.js`); the SE sheet opens with the basket rows below the fold (the cue shows); with an Ethereum fee error banner on SE the "Available / MAX" row is half cut (existing); the pinned row grows about 12 pt when the chip wraps; an intermittent Android keypad/resize race after a sheet closes (3 of about 20 closes; the keypad is up but the window does not resize; hiding and re-focusing fixes it). TX-1.UX2-QA stays open. |
| 2026-10-19 | TX-1 small buttons, neutral voice, Android keyboard avoidance | `claude/small-device-buttons-keyboard` from `redesign` `f31ab023`; shared buttons and height hook, NFC action reserve, Unlock loading reserve, `WizardUI`, new `AndroidKeyboardAvoidingForm`, Price and route, `DESIGN.md` | Contract: preserve canonical `AppButton`, `GradientButton`, `WizardFooter`, `SafeBottomActionStack`, typography, header, and Sent composition. Primary/secondary explicit and default heights resolve centrally to 44 on small windows; text/tonal stay unchanged. Paper Button does not forward hitSlop to its touchable, so compact actions use a Paper ripple wrapper with 2-point vertical hitSlop. Footer top padding changes 16 to 8, bottom spacing unchanged. Installed RN is 0.77.3: a source-executed fixture reproduces zero overlap after hide resets bottom while the frame is still contracted; a later restored layout can repair it, so persistence of the observed native fault is not proved. Android now measures only a full-height outer onLayout frame and applies overlap to an inner view, retaining the same header offset. Keyboard events update synchronously, last event wins; no delayed native reads or resync timer. Amount's Android refocus stays intact. Temporary non-Jest component checks pass 80 size cases, hitSlop/press/disabled checks, 20 batched hide/show cycles, event ordering, layout/header changes, open-keyboard Recipient mount, cleanup, and iOS padding/footer structure. Required design, safe-area, option-matrix, whitespace and complete Android development bundle checks pass. Button and string inventories are in `button-audit.local.md`. | Source/component fixtures and bundle only. No simulator, emulator, Metro server, push, or merge. Testers own rendered/device proof. Frees 20 dp (12 button + 8 footer). Worked 360x640 example: header origin 142, keyboard top 360, wrapped pin about 62, footer 60 leave about 96 dp for content; Available/MAX ends about 123 dp with the fiat unit chip, leaving about 27 dp short. Without that chip it ends about 91 dp. Network/error rows add height. These are source estimates, not device measurements. TX-1.SMALL-BUTTONS-KEYBOARD-QA stays open. |
| 2026-10-19 | TX-1.PRICE-ROUTE-DENSE: variation A and suggestions from 1% impact | `claude/price-route-sheet-dense`, based on `claude/small-device-buttons-keyboard`; `PriceRouteSheet.js`, compact `SelectionRow`, shared information-sheet styles, typography roles, `SheetScrollView` frame sizing, `usePriceImpact.js`, `DESIGN.md`, `TYPOGRAPHY.md` | Contract: owner-approved A. Basket choices come first with no sentence or section titles. Rows use the approved 48/40/52-point deviations. Only the basket list scrolls; the shared measured cue stays in it. Facts, the suggestion, and secondary Done stay fixed. Done follows the shared 44/56-point rule. Route and suggestion choices retain `useSheetDismissal` and all Amount callbacks. WARNING suggestions start from 1% impact and aim to halve it; DANGER keeps the 3% target. Both retain the 300 ms debounce, real candidate quote, measured percent, lower-impact gate, and stale-response cleanup. Checks passed: `corepack pnpm check:design` (30 sources), `corepack pnpm check:safe-areas --changed` (8 files), `corepack pnpm check:send-wizard-options`, `git diff --check`, Babel parse (9 changed/new JS files), and the complete Android development JS bundle (55 assets; environment color warnings only). Temporary non-Jest Node fixtures verify warning arithmetic (100 at 4.3% gives 48; 50 at 1.2% gives 24), 1/5% boundaries, measured lower/equal/higher/unavailable results, debounce replacement and cleanup, post-close callback order, and unchanged default selection/information styles in both themes. Source height sums: SE two baskets 350.5 versus 351 pt; DAI 200 334 versus 334; Ethereum 20 322 versus 322; 17 Pro two baskets 362.5 versus 363. Ten SE baskets use a 269.5-point viewport for 516 points of list content within a 520-point shell. These are source calculations, not device measurements. Bundle outputs and temporary fixtures removed. | Not verified: native layout, light/dark rendering, many-basket scrolling and cue, text scaling, live RPC suggestions, Android sheet-close/refocus. No simulator, emulator, dev server, push, or merge. Device QA pending (orchestrator) |
| 2026-10-19 | TX-1 history: remove conversion labels, neutral row | `claude/neutral-history-list` from `4462c81f`; `updates.js`, `standardizeTxObj.js`, `Overview.js`, `TxDetailsModal.js`, `DESIGN.md` | Owner decision: drop conversion recognition ("Convert to X", "Converted from X") and adopt option A of the history mockup. Removed: the per-receipt import reads, the per-spend reserve-transfer reads, the currency-name lookups, the `conversion` and `conversionProceeds` fields, the two subtitle overrides in `Overview.js`, and the sheet Type wording. Kept from `b3a1deb5`: grouping by txid, pending and mempool timestamps, the `keyExtractor`, and the `sent.outputs` guard. The history update now makes no per-transaction reads. Row: a 32-point `surfaceMuted` circle with a 16-point `textSecondary` arrow (down incoming, up outgoing); green only on an incoming amount; Pending uses the warning `StatusBadge` in place of the date; layout, chevron and skeleton unchanged. Rendered on iOS 26.5 simulator (Testnet profile, private chain, PTest iOS wallet, Metro serving this checkout): light, plain sends, and the received +0.01998497 row (the former "Converted from GOLD") now reads "My transparent address" with a gray arrow and a green amount; a real send of 0.0001 VRSCTEST showed the Pending badge on the top row; dark, the same pending row and the received row; the transaction sheet shows Type "Incoming" for the former proceeds row. Babel parse (4 files) and `check:design` (30 sources) pass. | Not verified: Android; iPhone SE 375pt and 360dp (row metrics are unchanged; only the date line can now be a badge); a pending row in a confirmed-then-pending sequence beyond the one send observed; ESLint cannot load in this repo (existing failure). No Jest test added (project rule). Not pushed. |
| 2026-10-20 | TX-1.PRICE-ROUTE-DENSE and TX-1.SMALL-BUTTONS-KEYBOARD device QA; Android keyboard container fix | `claude/price-route-sheet-dense` `62f958af` (contains `claude/small-device-buttons-keyboard`); `AndroidKeyboardAvoidingForm.js`, `MainActivity.java` | iOS (iPhone SE and iPhone 17 Pro simulators, VRSCTEST, branch bundle on port 8082): sheet A checks SA-0 to SA-12 and the small-device button checks pass (local evidence in `docs/qa/send-convert-ux-round-2/sheeta-ios`, `small3-ios`). Android (AVD `Small_360x640`, 720x1280 at 320 dpi): the hardening commit `faf564ce` failed 40 of 40 loop cycles, with Continue behind the keypad. Cause, read from logcat of the container: `Keyboard.metrics()` returns null on Android in this app, so the timed re-read cleared the stored keyboard frame 60 ms after every event, the padding fell to 0, and Continue stayed behind the keypad. The same clear ran in `af4e2c17` whenever the header offset changed after the keyboard showed (80 to 142 in the logs). That is the probable cause of the earlier 4 failures in 54 closes; this link is inferred, not proved. Fix `62f958af`: the container keeps only the frames from `keyboardDidShow` events, a module-level copy serves a form that mounts while the keyboard is open, the header offset is read through a ref, and no timer re-reads remain. `MainActivity` again leaves the first show to React Native and re-sends only when the IME inset changes while it stays visible (the second event, 275 dp then 231 dp 39 ms later, is visible in the logs). After the fix, measured from screenshots on Android 360x640: Continue at 666 to 754 px directly above the keypad in 25 of 25 close-and-reopen cycles (10 of them with six CPU-burning host processes, load average 16), 18 of 18 sheet closes (second basket, best basket, Done), 3 of 3 Amount-to-Recipient round trips and every first Amount entry after login (3 fresh logins); with the text keyboard on Recipient, Continue sits at 578 to 666 px above it. Sheet on Android 360: GOLD 0.05 with two baskets (basket rows first, three fact rows, Done 88 px = 44 dp); DAI 200 sheet 334 dp with the red Difference, Route Bridge.vETH and "Use 68 VRSCTEST instead 3.0% less", which applies 68 and shows the amber 3.0% chip with the keypad back; DAI 100 (4.3%) suggests 48 at 2.1% less; DAI 35 (1.5%) suggests 17 at 0.7% less; DAI 20 (0.8%) shows no suggestion; ten baskets (temporary patch, reverted): only the list scrolls, the fade and chevron show then disappear at the end, facts and Done stay fixed, dragging on the facts moves nothing; dark mode checked. Checks: `check:design` (30 sources), `check:safe-areas --changed`, Babel parse. Process note: the first Android tester left a detached Python loop running after its agent was stopped (found and killed); testers must use bounded loops with an early stop. | Not re-run on Android after the fix: Ethereum network sheet (Network fee row), Confirm/Sent regression (Arrives row, Sent without header), hold-to-confirm (no transaction sent this round), cold starts, address-book Add sheet cycles, Change password with the keyboard. Open: the label "Res..." in Change password on Android, "Lock wallet" stays 56 pt on the SE, five "We could not..." strings in `ReceivePaymentRequestFlow.js` and GenericRequest screens. No real transaction in this round. |
| 2026-10-20 | TX-1 copy: impersonal failure messages and a wider primary button in the Settings footer | `claude/neutral-copy-labels` from `redesign` `a08f6755`; `ReceivePaymentRequestFlow.js`, `GenericRequestHome.js`, `ConfirmPayStep.js`, `SettingsScaffold.js` | Owner request, 2026-10-20 ("fix the label strings", no test run). Five "We could not..." messages now follow the DESIGN.md Voice rule: "The payment request could not be created", "The share sheet could not be opened", "The QR image could not be saved", and "The response could not be sent to ..." (two places). "Reset password" cut off to "Res..." in the Change password footer: the first cause (the compact-button wrapper) went away in `9bee3cbd` and read in full on iPhone SE. Measured from Inter SemiBold 17 px: the label is 127.2 dp and a half-width button on a 360 dp window leaves 129 dp (Paper text-mode margin 12 dp each side), so it fits by about 2 dp and Android can still cut it. `SettingsActionFooter` now gives the primary button `flex: 1.6` against 1 for the secondary (360 dp: about 118 dp secondary, 188 dp primary; "Cancel" needs 79 dp). `check:design` (30 sources), `check:safe-areas --changed` and Babel parse pass. Not rendered on a device in this round. | Look at Change password, Delete wallet, Coin settings and Display seed footers on Android 360 dp and iPhone SE when the next device pass runs. "Lock wallet" stays 56 pt on the SE. |

Append one row per coherent delivery. Link safe local QA notes or durable evidence
where appropriate, and distinguish worktree verification from integration into
the target branch. Never check an item solely because a design image or source
patch exists.

### Resume note

- Branches: `redesign` is the integration branch. It started on 2026-10-10 at
  `8a80f4d6`, the tip of `codex/gr3-request-matrix`, which contains all earlier
  redesign branches. Start each new task branch from `redesign`. Merge it back
  with `git merge --no-ff` after its checks pass and this plan is current.
- NFC-1 (2026-10-11) restores reading a Verus NFC card in three places and
  adds the NFC tap screen to every NFC read and write (one commit). The GR-3.9
  phone session waits for it, so one session covers both.
- ID-1 is complete and locally integrated. The implementation and its
  high-risk review corrections (including the two final P2 lifecycle defects)
  are committed as `33865cab` on `codex/id1-redesign` and locally integrated
  into `codex/integrate-generic-request-upstream`; the matching origin branch
  remains behind until a separately authorized push. ID-1.10–1.11 are complete:
  rendered light/dark normal/compact empty/error/keyboard/processing states were
  captured on iOS fixtures, and the single independent high-risk reviewer
  (which also applied `max-product-design-taste` while reviewing the final
  renders) returned READY with all findings closed. Android, authenticated
  real-wallet, and full accessibility proof remain explicitly open, not
  implied.
- Last completed action: ID-1 finalization — the parent ran the focused ID-1
  checks, captured and verified the iOS fixture states, and obtained the single
  independent high-risk READY, then committed the verified candidate as
  `33865cab` and locally integrated it into
  `codex/integrate-generic-request-upstream`. RX-1 remains an accepted local
  delivery with the native system amount keypad, 196 native screenshots, 32
  passing focused checks, and ready independent high-risk/design reviews.
  RX-1.1–1.9 are
  complete for the scoped disposable-fixture delivery. The gallery and exact
  commit receipt are in `docs/rx1-qa-20260911`; no push or publication is part of
  this delivery.
- Next action: resume remaining TX-1 work when authorized. TX-1.6 retains
  authenticated back-navigation walkthroughs. Global QA-1 retains broader
  authenticated/runtime and accessibility proof beyond RX-1's sampled native
  and source verification; see the RX-1 QA report for exact limits.
- GR-1/GR-2 runtime follow-up is closed (GR-3.17, 2026-10-10). Recorded
  accessibility follow-ups remain: full VoiceOver/TalkBack walkthrough, reduced
  motion, and the app-wide text-scaling decision.
- Previously recorded GR runtime gap: the normal simulator has competing preview-app deeplink handlers;
  the compact simulator reaches the actual Testnet unlock sheet but its selected
  disposable profile could not be unlocked with the available setup. Isolated
  native fixtures verify rendering and interaction, not wallet signing or live
  callback delivery. No personal/mainnet wallet was unlocked.
- Owners: the GR-1/GR-2 follow-up task retains its runtime gaps; the next TX-1
  task owns the remaining Send/Convert work. ID-1 retains its explicit proof
  limits: iOS-only native evidence, with Android runtime, authenticated
  real-wallet, signing/funds, live RPC, and full accessibility proof still open.
